# Case 28-2003 — Comprehensive Clinical Vignette

## Source
- NEJM Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital, Case 28-2003 (downloaded from www.nejm.org). Pages 1076–1082 of the published record were reviewed and summarized.

## Demographics and relevant history
- Age/sex: 51-year-old woman, premenopausal at presentation.
- Family history: Strong maternal and paternal histories of early-onset breast cancer (maternal mother at 48, maternal grandmother at 47), paternal relatives with early breast cancer (paternal aunt and first cousin), father of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and affected by colon cancer.
- Reproductive history: Menarche at 13; two pregnancies, one live birth (first pregnancy at 32); no hormone-replacement therapy; prior oral contraceptive use for 6 years.
- Social history: Former smoker (10 pack-years, quit at 26), moderate alcohol use (1–4 drinks weekly).

## Presentation and timeline
- Presentation: A mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast was detected on physical examination three months before presentation.
- Initial diagnostic work-up performed elsewhere: Fine-needle aspirate showed atypical ductal cells; excisional biopsy revealed a 0.2-cm invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), with concurrent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).
- At referral: Routine hematologic and chemistry tests normal; bilateral mammography limited by dense breast tissue and recent surgery; chest radiographs unremarkable.

## Surgical staging and pathology
- Sentinel node staging: Lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel-node biopsy of the right axilla identified two radioactive nodes and one palpable node; standard pathologic analysis and cytokeratin immunostaining showed no metastatic carcinoma (node-negative).
- Excisional-biopsy pathology (initial): 0.2-cm focus of invasive lobular carcinoma (single-file/Indian-file pattern). Tumor ER and PR positive; HER2/neu not overexpressed (IHC negative).
- Mastectomy pathology: A second, separate 0.2-cm focus of invasive lobular carcinoma was found in the right mastectomy specimen (different location). Right breast also had DCIS, LCIS, and extensive atypical ductal hyperplasia. Prophylactic left mastectomy specimen contained LCIS and atypical ductal hyperplasia.
- Margins: Resection margins free of invasive tumor (closest invasive margin 0.4 cm; DCIS 0.2 cm).
- Pathologic summary (from report): Two foci of infiltrating lobular carcinoma (each 0.2 cm), DCIS of the right breast, LCIS and atypical ductal hyperplasia bilaterally.

## Biomarkers and molecular testing
- Hormone receptors: Estrogen receptor (ER) positive; progesterone receptor (PR) positive (extent/intensity not quantified in the original report).
- HER2: No overexpression (IHC negative) reported.
- Germline testing: Positive for the BRCA2 founder mutation 6174delT (exon 11). The report does not state variant allele fraction (VAF) or sequencing read depth for the germline result (not applicable to standard germline sequencing reporting in the case report).
- Somatic next-generation sequencing, tumor VAFs, tumor mutational burden (TMB), MSI, copy-number data, and PD-L1 testing were not reported in the scanned case report.

## Prior and definitive treatments performed
- Initial excisional biopsy (diagnostic) performed at outside institution.
- Sentinel lymph-node biopsy (axillary staging) — negative.
- After genetic counseling and receipt of BRCA2 6174delT result, the patient elected bilateral simple mastectomy (therapeutic right, prophylactic left) with immediate reconstruction (tissue expanders followed by saline implants).
- The patient subsequently elected and underwent laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (risk-reducing oophorectomy) after completion of childbearing; adnexa showed no occult carcinoma on histologic examination.
- No adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was recommended or administered for the index breast cancers given very small tumor size(s) and favorable features.
- Hormone-replacement therapy after oophorectomy was discussed but not recommended because of prior ER-positive breast cancer; calcium and vitamin D supplementation recommended; bone mineral density was normal.

## Clinical status and organ function
- Performance status: Not explicitly quantified in the report; patient was ambulatory, with manageable menopausal symptoms after BSO; laboratory studies normal (compatible with ECOG 0–1 at time of treatments).
- Cardiac, hepatic, renal function: Routine laboratories normal as reported; no end-organ dysfunction described.

## Clinical considerations emphasized by authors
- Strong family history from both maternal and paternal lineages and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry prompted targeted founder-mutation testing for BRCA1/2 and discovery of BRCA2 6174delT.
- The patient elected bilateral mastectomy for both therapeutic and prophylactic reasons; prophylactic oophorectomy was performed and no occult adnexal malignancy was found.
- The authors did not recommend systemic chemotherapy given the small size (T1a), node-negative status, and favorable prognostic features of the tumor; standard risk-reducing strategies (mastectomy and oophorectomy) were discussed as appropriate for BRCA2 carriers.

## Data gaps / not reported in the original case
- No tumor NGS report with somatic VAFs/read depth, copy-number changes, MSI or TMB, or PD-L1 testing was provided in the case record.
- Quantitative ER/PR expression (percent staining and intensity) and exact HER2 IHC or FISH numeric results were not listed in the summary (only qualitative statements).

## Q1 (006_1)

Based on current guideline recommendations and the patient’s tumor biology (0.2-cm, ER+/PR+, HER2−, node-negative invasive lobular carcinoma), should adjuvant endocrine therapy be recommended, and if so, which agent and for what duration given that she subsequently underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy?

### Answer 1

Yes — offer adjuvant endocrine therapy. For premenopausal patients with ER+ invasive breast cancer, adjuvant endocrine therapy reduces recurrence; tamoxifen 20 mg daily for at least 5 years is the standard initial recommendation for premenopausal women, including many T1a tumors, unless risks/benefits favor omission. After bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (surgical menopause), she is functionally postmenopausal; options include tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AIs require postmenopausal status). Given the very small tumor size and low absolute benefit, tamoxifen for 5 years is reasonable with shared decision-making regarding extension. Source guidelines support offering endocrine therapy to ER+ patients and individualized decisions for tiny tumors.

## Q2 (006_2)

Does the presence of a germline BRCA2 6174delT mutation and the tumor’s histology and stage (two separate 0.2-cm foci of ILC, node-negative) change the indication for adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy in this patient at the time of initial management?

### Answer 2

No — a pathogenic germline BRCA2 variant alone does not mandate adjuvant chemotherapy for very small (T1a), node-negative, ER+/PR+ HER2− tumors with favorable features. Contemporary guidance reserves chemotherapy for higher-risk clinical or genomic features (larger T stage, node-positive disease, high grade, or high genomic-risk scores). Therefore omission of chemotherapy in this case is guideline-consistent.

---

## Q3 (006_3)

Would this patient have been eligible for adjuvant olaparib per the OlympiA trial, and is adjuvant olaparib indicated in her current clinical situation?

### Answer 3

No — she would not have been eligible for adjuvant olaparib in OlympiA and adjuvant olaparib is not indicated in her situation. OlympiA enrolled gBRCA1/2 carriers with high-risk, HER2-negative early breast cancer (generally stage II–III or residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or node-positive disease) who had received (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. This patient had small T1a tumors, was node-negative, and did not receive chemotherapy, so she does not meet the trial eligibility criteria.

## Q4 (006_4)

Given the family pedigree (early-onset breast cancers in both maternal and paternal lineages and an identified BRCA2 6174delT mutation), what specific genetic testing strategy should be recommended to first-degree and second-degree relatives, and what syndromic cancer risks should be discussed for male relatives?

### Answer 4

Recommend targeted cascade testing for the known familial pathogenic BRCA2 variant (6174delT) to first-degree relatives (children, siblings, parents) and offer testing to at-risk second-degree relatives (aunts, uncles, cousins) after genetic counseling. In Ashkenazi-Jewish families, testing can start with the recurrent founder mutation (cost-effective) and proceed to full sequencing if indicated. Male BRCA2 carriers should be counseled about increased risks of prostate cancer (potentially aggressive), male breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer, and offered appropriate screening discussions.

---

## Q5 (006_5)

For BRCA2 6174delT carriers, what is the recommended timing for risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), and was the timing chosen by the patient consistent with current recommendations?

### Answer 5

For BRCA2 carriers, RRSO is generally recommended later than for BRCA1, with many guidelines suggesting RRSO by age 40–45 as reasonable for BRCA2 (BRCA1 often advised by 35–40). The patient underwent RRSO after completing childbearing at age 51; while later than guideline-recommended ages for optimal ovarian-cancer risk reduction, RRSO at 51 still confers protective benefit. Timing decisions must balance fertility, age-related risk onset differences between BRCA1 and BRCA2, and patient preferences.

---

## Q6 (006_6)

The patient and team discussed hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) after RRSO; for a BRCA2 carrier with prior ER+ breast cancer, what is the guideline-concordant recommendation regarding HRT for menopausal symptom control?

### Answer 6

HRT decisions should be individualized. For BRCA carriers who are unaffected, short-term estrogen-only HRT after oophorectomy may be considered for symptom control. However, in carriers with a personal history of ER-positive breast cancer, HRT is approached with caution and is generally not recommended; nonhormonal therapies are preferred first. If HRT is considered for severe refractory symptoms, multidisciplinary counseling and shared decision-making are required, using the shortest effective regimen. In the reported case, clinicians advised against HRT — a conservative, guideline-concordant approach.

## Q7 (006_7)

Considering the histology (invasive lobular carcinoma) and the reported limitations of mammography in dense breasts post-biopsy, would preoperative breast MRI have been appropriate in this case to evaluate disease extent, and how would MRI findings potentially have changed management?

### Answer 7

Yes — preoperative breast MRI is reasonable in invasive lobular carcinoma because MRI detects additional ipsilateral or contralateral foci in a significant minority (~20–35%) of ILC patients and is more sensitive than mammography, particularly in dense breasts. MRI can alter surgical management (wider excision or mastectomy) if additional disease is identified. In this patient, MRI would have been an appropriate consideration given dense breasts and lobular histology; the eventual finding of a second 0.2-cm focus on mastectomy specimen is consistent with MRI's ability to detect additional foci in some patients.

## Q8 (006_8)

If, hypothetically, this patient develops distant metastatic, HER2-negative breast cancer in the future, how would the known germline BRCA2 6174delT alter systemic therapy options in the metastatic setting?

### Answer 8

In metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer with a germline BRCA pathogenic variant, PARP inhibitors (olaparib, talazoparib) are evidence-based systemic therapy options that improve progression-free survival versus chemotherapy and are guideline-supported. Therefore, if she later developed metastatic disease, a PARP inhibitor would be a targeted therapeutic option, with prior exposure to PARP agents in the adjuvant setting (not applicable here) affecting sequencing decisions.

---

## Q9 (006_9)

Would a multigene genomic assay (e.g., Oncotype DX) have been helpful to decide adjuvant chemotherapy for this patient, and is it validated for T1a tumors of 0.2 cm?

### Answer 9

Genomic recurrence-score assays can inform chemotherapy benefit in ER+/HER2−, node-negative disease, but evidence for routine use in very small tumors (T1a, ≤0.5 cm) is limited. Most validation cohorts focus on tumors ≥0.5 cm; while assays may be technically feasible on small specimens, there is limited evidence that results should alter management in 0.2-cm lesions. Thus, in this patient, genomic assays are unlikely to change management and are not routinely recommended for T1a tumors.

---

## Q10 (006_10)

After bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction for a BRCA2 carrier, what surveillance is recommended for breast cancer recurrence and for subsequent gynecologic malignancies, and which screening tests are not recommended routinely?

### Answer 10

Post risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy, residual breast tissue can remain; recommended surveillance is regular clinical breast/chest-wall exams and prompt evaluation of signs or symptoms. Routine imaging of reconstructed breasts is not generally recommended unless clinical concerns arise. For ovarian/tubal/peritoneal cancer after RRSO, there is no effective proven screening (CA-125 and transvaginal ultrasound do not reduce mortality); RRSO is the principal risk-reducing intervention. Continued vigilance for peritoneal symptoms and counseling about other BRCA-associated cancer risks (pancreas, prostate) are appropriate.
