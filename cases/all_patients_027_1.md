## Case

# Case vignette — NEJM_case_027 (Iwasawa et al., BMC Medical Genomics 2022)

## Demographics and relevant history
- Patient: 61-year-old man, previously healthy prior to presentation.  
- Presenting complaint: palpable mass on the head; imaging raised suspicion for skull metastasis.  

## Timeline and clinical course
- Month 0: Presentation with skull mass; MRI head with gadolinium demonstrated an enhancing lesion with cortical involvement; PSA at presentation 165.42 ng/mL. CT pelvis showed osteolytic lesion adjacent to enlarged prostate; bone scan demonstrated widely disseminated osseous metastases (spine, pelvis, ribs, femora).  
- Diagnostic prostate needle biopsy: adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 5 + 4 = 9. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with an LH-RH agonist and antiandrogen (bicalutamide) was initiated.  
- Month 12: Rising PSA and postrenal failure due to urinary retention → channel transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP); tumor tissue from TURP used for genomic profiling.  
- Following castration resistance: docetaxel given for seven cycles (started after castration resistance recognized) with initial but ultimately inadequate control; disease progressed with worsening lymph node and bone metastases.  
- Subsequent systemic therapy: cabazitaxel administered for six courses but discontinued because of sacral pressure-ulcer infection and decline in the patient’s general condition. Abiraterone was later administered.  
- Outcome: The patient died 2 years and 6 months (≈30 months) after initial diagnosis.

## Tumor burden and biomarkers
- Staging: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with diffuse bone metastases and nodal disease; evidence of high tumor burden and aggressive clinical behavior.  
- Serum markers: PSA markedly elevated at presentation (165.42 ng/mL); PSA initially declined on ADT, then rose; neuron-specific enolase (NSE) rose alongside PSA later in the course, suggesting possible evolving neuroendocrine phenotype though not confirmed by IHC.  

## Histopathology and immunohistochemistry (TURP specimen)
- Histology: Adenocarcinoma composed of large tumor cells with abundant cytoplasm, prominent clear nucleoli, high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, frequent mitoses; morphology described as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma without typical neuroendocrine architecture.  
- IHC summary:  
  - RB1: complete absence of expression (consistent with genomic RB1 loss).  
  - p53: complete absence of expression (consistent with truncating TP53 mutation).  
  - AR: nuclear staining positive in ~70% of tumor cells.  
  - PSA: positive in ~30% of tumor cells.  
  - Neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin, chromogranin A, CD56): negative.  
  - GLI1: <10% tumor cells positive; no evidence for robust hedgehog pathway activation.

## Molecular/genomic findings (160-gene panel — PleSSision-Rapid® on TURP specimen)
- RB1: co-deletion with BRCA2; described as biallelic loss (co-loss of RB1 and BRCA2).  
- BRCA2: co-deletion with RB1 (biallelic loss reported).  
- TP53: truncating frameshift mutation G244Rfs*19; absence of p53 protein by IHC corroborates an inactivating event.  
- AR: high-level amplification; estimated copy number ≈ 18.3.  
- PTCH1: missense point mutation p.R441H (reported as possibly pathogenic but without functional evidence of hedgehog activation; GLI1 IHC not upregulated).  
- Notes on VAF/read depth: The report did not provide variant allele fractions (VAF) or sequencing read-depth metrics for each variant in the published case report; only presence/absence and estimated AR copy-number were reported.

## Prior treatments, responses, and toxicities
- ADT (LH-RH agonist ± bicalutamide): initial PSA response followed by biochemical and clinical progression at ~12 months.  
- TURP for urinary retention and postrenal failure.  
- Docetaxel: seven cycles for CRPC; disease progression thereafter.  
- Cabazitaxel: six courses, discontinued because of sacral pressure-ulcer infection and clinical deterioration (treatment-limiting toxicity/infection).  
- Abiraterone administered subsequently (timing after cabazitaxel not effective to prevent death).  

## Performance status and organ function
- The report documents deterioration of general condition late in the course, an episode of postrenal failure (urinary retention) at ~12 months, and a significant sacral pressure-ulcer infection that interrupted therapy — all indicating compromised performance status and complicating further cytotoxic therapy. Formal ECOG performance status was not explicitly recorded in the manuscript.

## Clinical interpretation (summary)
- This is an aggressive, AR-positive but poorly differentiated mCRPC with high tumor burden and genomic features associated with treatment resistance and lineage plasticity: co-loss of RB1 and BRCA2 with an inactivating TP53 mutation and high-level AR amplification.  
- Molecularly the tumor harbors homologous-recombination repair (HRR) deficiency (BRCA2 loss) — a predictive biomarker for PARP-inhibitor sensitivity — and concurrent RB1/TP53 inactivation associated with aggressive behavior, lineage plasticity, and possible chemotherapy sensitivity to platinum agents in certain contexts.  
- Clinical management was limited by infectious complications and decline in general condition; posthumous genomic profiling underscores potential opportunities (PARP inhibitors, platinum-based chemotherapy or trials) that may have been considered had performance status and timing permitted.

## Q1 (027_1)

Given this patient’s documented biallelic BRCA2 loss on tumor sequencing, prior progression on abiraterone and taxanes, and preserved AR nuclear staining in ~70% of tumor cells with AR amplification (estimated copy number ≈18.3), would treatment with a PARP inhibitor (e.g., olaparib) have been an evidence-based option, and what is the guideline-anchored indication and expected clinical rationale?

### Answer 1

Yes. For patients with mCRPC and deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA2 alterations who have progressed on a prior androgen-receptor–directed therapy (enzalutamide or abiraterone), olaparib is an evidence-based, guideline-recognized option. The PROfound trial demonstrated clinical benefit (improved rPFS and overall survival signals in HRR-deficient cohorts) and regulatory labeling (FDA) and NCCN incorporate PARP inhibitors for BRCA-altered mCRPC. The patient’s documented BRCA2 biallelic loss (tumor-based) and prior abiraterone exposure satisfy enrollment-style criteria; high-level AR amplification does not preclude PARP inhibitor use, though it predicts persistent AR signaling and may influence combination strategies.

---

## Q2 (027_2)

How does the co-loss of RB1 and BRCA2 together with an inactivating TP53 truncating mutation (G244Rfs*19) alter prognostic expectations and influence selection between PARP inhibitor therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy for this patient?

### Answer 2

Co-loss of RB1 with TP53 inactivation predicts aggressive biology, lineage plasticity, and worse prognosis; BRCA2 loss predicts PARP sensitivity and potential sensitivity to platinum agents. The optimal choice depends on goals: PARP inhibitor therapy is indicated and less myelotoxic; platinum chemotherapy (e.g., carboplatin-containing regimens) may be considered for rapidly progressive, aggressive variant or if clinical features suggest small-cell/neuroendocrine transformation, and data suggests heightened activity of platinum in DDR-deficient disease. Therefore, either approach could be justified; PARP inhibitor therapy is guideline-supported given BRCA2 biallelic loss and prior AR-directed therapy, while platinum may be preferential in rapidly progressive or visceral/neuroendocrine phenotypes.

---

## Q3 (027_3)

If tumor sequencing had reported variant allele frequencies (VAFs) and read depths showing high VAFs (e.g., >40–50%) for BRCA2 and TP53 alterations, how would that influence confidence in clonality and therapeutic decision-making for this patient?

### Answer 3

High VAFs for BRCA2 and TP53 (particularly in a tumor sample without extensive normal-cell admixture) increase confidence that these are clonal, truncal events present in a large proportion of cancer cells, strengthening the rationale for systemic therapies targeting those alterations (PARP inhibitors for BRCA2 loss). Low or subclonal VAFs would lower confidence in durability of response to targeted therapy. The published report did not provide VAF/read-depth metrics; lack of VAF data reduces certainty about clonality and could affect decisions about single-agent targeted therapy versus cytotoxic approaches.

---

## Q4 (027_4)

The TURP specimen showed AR expression in ~70% of nuclei and PSA expression in ~30% of tumor cells, without neuroendocrine marker expression, but with rising NSE late in the course. How should this affect consideration for platinum chemotherapy or neuroendocrine-directed therapy?

### Answer 4

The IHC findings (AR+, PSA partial, neuroendocrine markers negative) argue against overt small-cell/neuroendocrine carcinoma at the time of sampling. However, rising NSE and concurrent RB1/TP53 loss suggest evolving lineage plasticity and possible emergent neuroendocrine features. Without positive neuroendocrine markers or small-cell morphology, standard cytotoxic regimens for adenocarcinoma (including taxanes or PARP therapy if indicated) remain appropriate; if clear clinical or pathological transformation to neuroendocrine/small-cell phenotype occurs, platinum–etoposide regimens are guideline-recommended. Empiric use of platinum could be considered for aggressive, rapidly progressive disease even absent full neuroendocrine conversion, particularly with RB1/TP53 alterations.

---

## Q5 (027_5)

Considering the AR amplification (CN ≈ 18.3) and prior exposure to next-generation AR pathway agents, what are the implications for re-challenging AR-directed therapy or combining AR-directed therapy with PARP inhibition in this patient?

### Answer 5

High-level AR amplification is associated with resistance to AR-directed therapy and predicts limited benefit from re-challenge with AR inhibitors alone. Combination AR-directed therapy plus PARP inhibition (e.g., olaparib + abiraterone) has been evaluated in trials and may benefit some BRCA-mutant patients, but single-agent PARP inhibitor remains an approved approach after prior AR-directed therapy. Given AR amplification and prior progression on abiraterone, re-challenge with AR-targeted monotherapy would be unlikely to produce durable benefit; combining with PARP inhibitor could be considered within trial settings or per updated label indications where applicable (and when safety/performance status permit).

---

## Q6 (027_6)

Which clinical-trial types and eligibility features (at the time of this patient’s care) would be most appropriate to offer given his genomic profile (BRCA2 biallelic loss, RB1/TP53 co-loss, AR amplification) and clinical status (prior docetaxel, cabazitaxel discontinued for infection, abiraterone exposure, ECOG not recorded but general decline late)? Provide trial classes and key eligibility considerations.

### Answer 6

Appropriate trial classes would include: (1) PARP inhibitor monotherapy or PARP combinations (e.g., PARP + AR-targeted agents) for BRCA2-deficient disease; (2) platinum-based chemotherapy trials or chemo–targeted combinations for aggressive-variant/DDR-deficient disease; (3) trials targeting lineage plasticity (e.g., CDK4/6 or agents targeting lineage drivers) or TP53/RB1-associated pathways; (4) trials of antibody–drug conjugates or PSMA-targeted therapies (if PSMA status known). Key eligibility: measurable mCRPC, prior exposure to AR-directed therapy (required for PROfound-style PARP studies), adequate organ function (cardiac, hepatic, renal, marrow), and performance status (often ECOG ≤2). The patient’s infectious complications and clinical deterioration could limit eligibility for cytotoxic/combination trials requiring good performance status.

## Q7 (027_7)

If re-biopsy at progression revealed new emergence of a TP53 wild-type subclone with loss of the previously detected TP53 frameshift (G244Rfs*19) and persistence of BRCA2 loss, how would that change interpretation of resistance mechanisms and subsequent therapeutic prioritization?

### Answer 7

Emergence of a TP53 wild-type subclone implies intratumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution; persistence of BRCA2 loss maintains HRR deficiency and potential PARP sensitivity. Loss (or absence) of TP53 inactivation would reduce the inferred contribution of TP53-driven lineage plasticity to resistance; therapy prioritization would still favor PARP inhibitor given persistent BRCA2 loss. Heterogeneity suggests combining systemic cytotoxic approaches or multisite sampling to guide therapy. Clinical decisions would weigh which clone is dominant (by VAF) and the pace of progression.

---

## Q8 (027_8)

In light of the reported PTCH1 p.R441H variant and minimal GLI1 nuclear staining (<10%), is hedgehog pathway inhibition (e.g., vismodegib) a biologically rational targeted therapy for this patient?

### Answer 8

No—based on available data this is not a rational therapeutic choice. The PTCH1 p.R441H variant is of uncertain significance in prostate cancer and GLI1 IHC did not demonstrate pathway activation; functional evidence that PTCH1 p.R441H is a driver in this tumor is lacking. Targeted hedgehog inhibition would not be recommended outside of a clinical trial with correlative evidence of pathway activation.

---

## Q9 (027_9)

Given the patient’s clinical course (PSA response to initial ADT then castration resistance at ~12 months, prior taxanes and AR-targeted therapy, sacral pressure-ulcer infection limiting cytotoxic therapy), outline an evidence-based sequencing plan of systemic therapies you would have proposed immediately after genomic results became available, assuming preserved ECOG ≤2 and adequate organ function.

### Answer 9

Evidence-based sequencing (assuming adequate performance status): 1) Initiate a PARP inhibitor (olaparib) given documented biallelic BRCA2 loss and prior abiraterone exposure (PROfound-like criteria); 2) If rapid symptomatic progression or if neuroendocrine/small-cell histology emerges, consider platinum-based chemotherapy (e.g., carboplatin-containing regimen) or cabazitaxel (if not previously intolerant) as cytotoxic options; 3) Consider clinical-trial enrollment for PARP combinations (PARP + AR blockade or PARP + immunotherapy) or novel agents targeting lineage plasticity; 4) Provide palliative bone-directed therapies (denosumab/zoledronic acid, radiation) and supportive care.

## Q10 (027_10)

List three laboratory or pathology data elements not reported in the case that would materially affect therapeutic choice and provide a brief explanation for how each would alter management.

### Answer 10

1) Tumor or germline VAFs and read-depth for BRCA2/TP53/RB1: High clonal VAFs increase confidence in targeting BRCA2 (PARP therapy); low/subclonal VAFs might favor cytotoxic or combination approaches. 2) Formal ECOG performance status and comprehensive organ-function labs (CBC with differential, creatinine, bilirubin, albumin): These determine eligibility for PARP inhibitors (renal dosing), cytotoxic chemotherapy, and trial enrollment; infection and marrow reserve would preclude cytotoxic therapy. 3) Repeat biopsy or liquid biopsy (cfDNA) at progression with sequencing and neuroendocrine marker re-assessment: Confirmation of neuroendocrine transformation (positive synaptophysin/chromogranin/CD56 or small-cell morphology) would move management toward platinum–etoposide regimens and away from AR re-challenge.
