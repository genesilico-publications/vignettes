## Case

# Case 19-2010 (NEJM Case 016) — Vignette

## Identifying information and history
- Age/sex: 35‑year‑old man.
- Relevant history/comorbidities: Hyperlipidemia treated with atorvastatin; prior bilateral herniorrhaphies, dental procedures. No tobacco or illicit drug use. No known family history of colorectal polyps or cancer.

## Presentation and timeline
- ~3 weeks before presentation: multiple episodes of bright red rectal bleeding and left‑sided abdominal discomfort after meals.
- Day −18: CT abdomen at outside hospital: thickening of the cecal and appendiceal wall; multiple small nodules in the greater omentum.
- Day −17: Upper GI radiographic series: lobular mass near the ileocecal valve extending into the cecum and an extrinsic mass around the terminal ileum.
- Day −14: Colonoscopy: edematous, erythematous, friable, hemorrhagic ulcer at the ileocecal valve; biopsies showed invasive adenocarcinoma (well to moderately differentiated).
- Day −7: Combined PET‑CT (20.3 mCi 18F‑FDG): intense FDG uptake in the cecal mass; multiple small omental soft‑tissue nodules (non‑FDG avid), small pelvic ascites, several small pulmonary nodules (≤9 mm) with low FDG uptake.
- Referred to tertiary cancer center for management.

## Examination and baseline labs
- Performance: Appeared well; normal vital signs.
- Height 188.0 cm, weight 88.9 kg, BMI 25.2.
- Abdomen: soft, non‑tender, no organomegaly, no palpable masses.
- Baseline labs: CEA 10.2 ng/mL (reference 0–2.5); otherwise hemoglobin, WBC, electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, coagulation normal.

## Surgical pathology and staging
- Colonoscopic biopsy (this hospital) and subsequent resection: moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma with glandular formation and desmoplastic stroma.
- Resection specimen: tumor penetrated through muscularis propria into pericolic fat with tumor deposits on the visceral serosa and omental metastases.
- Nodal status: 2 of 32 lymph nodes positive.
- Pathologic stage: pT4 (serosal involvement)/pN1/ M1 (peritoneal and lung metastases) → AJCC stage IV (T4N1M1).

## Radiology
- CT abdomen/pelvis: heterogeneous masslike thickening of the cecum with numerous small (5–10 mm) omental/peritoneal implants and minimal ascites.
- Chest CT: multiple small pulmonary nodules (largest 7–9 mm) consistent with metastatic disease.
- PET: intense FDG uptake in primary cecal lesion; peritoneal nodules relatively non‑avid (consistent with limitations of PET for small peritoneal or mucinous deposits); low‑level uptake in pulmonary nodules.

## Biomarker and molecular testing
- Mismatch repair / MSI testing: PCR for 10 microsatellite loci — microsatellite instability not detected (MSS). Immunohistochemistry for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2: intact nuclear staining in tumor cells → no evidence of dMMR/Lynch syndrome.
- KRAS testing: PCR‑based sequencing of exon 2 (codons 12/13) — no KRAS mutations detected (KRAS exon 2 wild‑type reported). No additional RAS/BRAF results reported in the case.
- Chromosomal alterations: Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of TP53 and APC detected, indicating chromosomal instability consistent with conventional APC–β‑catenin pathway tumorigenesis.
- VAF/read depth / copy number / TMB: not reported in the published case; no BRAF V600E, HER2, or other actionable alterations noted in the report.

## Prior treatments, responses, and toxicities
- Surgery: Right hemicolectomy (resection of right colon with distal ileum and right transverse colon) performed; omental and pelvic metastases documented at laparotomy; stapled anastomosis constructed.
- Systemic therapy course:
  - Started FOLFIRI 1 month after surgery.
  - After cycle 1 of FOLFIRI developed small‑bowel obstruction requiring re‑exploration, lysis of adhesions, and resection of bowel segment (two‑week hospitalization). Because of fear of further GI complications, bevacizumab was avoided.
  - Given KRAS exon 2 wild‑type status, cetuximab was added to FOLFIRI (FOLFIRI + cetuximab).
  - Treated 6 months with FOLFIRI + cetuximab → excellent response; imaging after 6 months showed no obvious metastatic disease; entered chemotherapy holiday.
  - ~6 months later: rising CEA and enlargement of lung nodules → re‑initiated FOLFIRI + cetuximab → disease stable for 6 months.
  - Subsequent progression with new bone lesions and rising CEA → switched to FOLFOX + bevacizumab; after 3 months, bone disease progressed with pain requiring palliative radiotherapy and analgesics.
  - Patient declined phase‑1 trials and, just over 2 years after diagnosis, opted for palliative care only.

## Current physiologic status at time of last report
- Disease course: Progressive metastatic colorectal cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis, lung metastases, and bone metastases despite sequential multiline therapy (FOLFIRI ± cetuximab, FOLFOX + bevacizumab).
- Performance status not explicitly quantified in the case record at each time point, but the patient remained sufficiently functional to undergo multiple systemic regimens and surgery until late in the disease course; ultimately elected palliative care ~2 years after diagnosis.
- Organ function: baseline renal and hepatic function reported normal; no laboratory evidence of organ failure in the published report.

## Key clinical points and implications for precision oncology
- Early‑onset colon cancer (age 35) — hereditary syndromes considered but testing argued against Lynch syndrome (intact MMR by IHC and MSI‑PCR negative) and no family history reported.
- Tumor follows chromosomal‑instability (CIN) pathway (APC/TP53 LOH) rather than MSI pathway.
- KRAS exon 2 wild‑type allowed the use of anti‑EGFR therapy (cetuximab) historically; modern guidance additionally considers tumor sidedness (right‑sided tumors such as cecal primaries derive less benefit from anti‑EGFR agents).
- Peritoneal disease and prior bowel complications increased concern for bevacizumab‑associated GI perforation; this influenced initial therapy choices.

Notes: The original NEJM case report did not provide variant allele frequencies, read depths, broad NGS panel results, tumor mutational burden (TMB), or copy‑number data beyond the LOH findings; these data would be relevant to contemporary precision‑oncology decisions and trial selection but are not available from the source report.

## Q1 (016_1)

Considering this patient’s primary tumor is cecal (right‑sided) and the tumor was reported as KRAS exon‑2 wild‑type but without extended RAS/BRAF testing, what is the current evidence‑based recommendation about the use of anti‑EGFR monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab/panitumumab) in the first‑line management of metastatic disease for this patient?

### Answer 1

Current guideline and high‑level evidence recommend that anti‑EGFR monoclonal antibodies provide greater benefit when combined with chemotherapy for left‑sided, RAS/BRAF wild‑type colorectal primaries; right‑sided primaries (including cecal tumors) derive substantially less benefit from anti‑EGFR therapy and are generally favored to receive chemotherapy plus an anti‑VEGF agent (e.g., bevacizumab) as first‑line systemic treatment when RAS/BRAF testing is complete. Extended RAS (KRAS/NRAS exons 2/3/4) and BRAF testing are required before considering anti‑EGFR therapy.

## Q2 (016_2)

Given that this tumor was microsatellite stable (MSS) by PCR and showed intact MLH1/MSH2/MSH6/PMS2 by IHC, would pembrolizumab be indicated as first‑line therapy in this patient today, and why or why not?

### Answer 2

No — pembrolizumab is indicated as first‑line therapy for unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer only when the tumor is MSI‑High (MSI‑H) or mismatch‑repair deficient (dMMR). This patient is MSS/dMMR‑intact, so pembrolizumab is not indicated as first‑line monotherapy on the basis of MSI status.

---

## Q3 (016_3)

At initial treatment planning the team avoided bevacizumab because of the patient’s postoperative small‑bowel obstruction and peritoneal carcinomatosis. Is this avoidance consistent with evidence regarding bevacizumab safety in such settings, and what is the magnitude of the risk that informed that choice?

### Answer 3

Yes — avoiding bevacizumab was reasonable. Clinical series and reviews show an increased risk of gastrointestinal perforation with bevacizumab in patients with intra‑abdominal disease, particularly with an intact primary tumor, recent bowel obstruction, or peritoneal carcinomatosis. Reported perforation risk is low but clinically significant (around 1–3% in many series) and associated with high morbidity and mortality.

## Q4 (016_4)

The NEJM report documents KRAS exon‑2 wild‑type by PCR but does not report NRAS/BRAF status or allele fraction. From a precision‑oncology perspective at treatment decision time, what molecular tests should be obtained before recommending EGFR‑directed therapy and why?

### Answer 4

Before EGFR‑targeted therapy, comprehensive RAS testing (KRAS and NRAS exons 2, 3, and 4) and BRAF V600E testing are required. Extended NGS panels (including HER2, NTRK, MSI, and TMB) are increasingly standard. Presence of any activating RAS or BRAF V600E predicts lack of benefit from anti‑EGFR antibodies. Reporting VAF and read depth (and using ctDNA if tissue limited) is recommended to detect low‑frequency resistant subclones.

---

## Q5 (016_5)

At presentation this patient had both peritoneal carcinomatosis and small pulmonary metastases. Would cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) be indicated, and what does the randomized evidence (PRODIGE‑7) say about adding oxaliplatin‑based HIPEC to CRS for colorectal peritoneal metastases?

### Answer 5

CRS + HIPEC may be considered in highly selected patients with disease confined to the peritoneum and without extraperitoneal metastases. Because this patient had synchronous pulmonary metastases, he would not be an appropriate candidate for curative CRS/HIPEC. PRODIGE‑7 showed no overall survival benefit from adding oxaliplatin‑based HIPEC to complete cytoreductive surgery, tempering support for routine oxaliplatin‑HIPEC outside clinical trials.

---

## Q6 (016_6)

The patient had an excellent response to FOLFIRI + cetuximab for 6 months, relapsed after a chemotherapy holiday, regained stability after re‑induction with the same regimen for another 6 months, then later progressed. What are the principal molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR antibodies in colorectal cancer, and how can these mechanisms guide the decision to rechallenge with an anti‑EGFR agent?

### Answer 6

Common acquired resistance mechanisms include emergence of RAS mutations (KRAS/NRAS), BRAF mutations, EGFR extracellular‑domain mutations, and amplifications/activation of alternative RTKs (MET, HER2). These can be detected in ctDNA; trials such as CHRONOS demonstrate that selecting patients for EGFR rechallenge based on absence of resistance mutations in ctDNA improves response rates. Therefore, ctDNA testing at the time of rechallenge is recommended to exclude resistance clones.

---

## Q7 (016_7)

If you obtained a plasma ctDNA assay at the time of relapse and detected a KRAS G12D mutation at 0.6% VAF with adequate read depth, how would you interpret this finding with respect to anti‑EGFR therapy and what would you recommend?

### Answer 7

A detectable activating RAS mutation in plasma (even at low VAF, if analytically validated) indicates a resistant subclone and predicts lack of benefit from EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Anti‑EGFR therapy would not be recommended while the mutation is present; alternative systemic options or clinical trials should be pursued. Repeated ctDNA testing may track decay of the clone for potential future rechallenge.

---

## Q8 (016_8)

After progression with bone metastases following FOLFOX + bevacizumab the patient was offered later‑line options and trials but eventually pursued palliation. In the modern setting (post‑2015), what FDA‑approved or guideline‑recommended systemic therapy options would be reasonable third‑ or later‑line therapies for a patient with MSS, RAS/BRAF WT (assume extended RAS WT) colorectal cancer who has received irinotecan‑ and oxaliplatin‑based regimens and anti‑EGFR therapy?

### Answer 8

Reasonable later‑line systemic options include trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS‑102) and regorafenib, both FDA‑approved for refractory mCRC. If actionable alterations (BRAF V600E, HER2 amplification, NTRK fusion, MSI‑H) are present, targeted therapies or trials are prioritized. ctDNA‑guided anti‑EGFR rechallenge is an evidence‑supported experimental approach when resistant clones are absent. Enrollment in clinical trials and comprehensive NGS is recommended.

---

## Q9 (016_9)

Given the patient’s age (35 years) and the tumor’s MSS status with no family history reported, should germline hereditary‑cancer testing still be pursued, and what genes/panels should be considered?

### Answer 9

Yes — germline hereditary cancer testing is recommended for patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer younger than 50 years regardless of family history. Testing should include Lynch‑syndrome genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM), APC, MUTYH (consider both monoallelic and biallelic contexts), and broader multi‑gene panels per genetic counseling. Tumor MSS/IHC intact does not exclude hereditary predisposition.

---

## Q10 (016_10)

What contemporary tumor‑ and blood‑based biomarkers and monitoring strategies (beyond radiographic imaging and CEA) would you implement in this patient’s follow‑up to optimize detection of recurrence/progression and inform precision therapy decisions?

### Answer 10

Implement plasma ctDNA assays for MRD surveillance after surgery, early recurrence detection, and real‑time detection of emergent resistance mutations (RAS/BRAF/EGFR ECD). Perform comprehensive NGS (tumor tissue and/or ctDNA) to identify actionable alterations (BRAF V600E, HER2, NTRK, MSI, TMB). Ensure assays report VAF and read depth, and integrate results with radiology, CEA, and clinical status to guide therapy and trial selection.
