# Case vignette: NEJM Case 13-2007 — A 46-year-old woman with gynecologic and intestinal cancers

## Patient demographics and relevant history
- Age/sex: 46-year-old woman.
- Past medical history: Hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine). Occasional cigarette use; social alcohol use. Four early miscarriages; two prior unsuccessful IVF cycles. No known diethylstilbestrol exposure.
- Family history: Strong maternal family history of colorectal and endometrial cancers (mother with endometrial cancer at age 50 and colon polyps; maternal grandfather with colorectal cancer at 55; maternal grandmother breast cancer at 70). Pedigree notable for multiple relatives with colorectal neoplasia (see NEJM Fig. 1).

## Presentation and timeline
- 15 weeks prior: Routine Pap smear showed atypical glandular cells, prompting gynecologic evaluation.
- 8 weeks prior: Abdominal CT identified a hypervascular liver lesion (later characterized as benign) and a parapelvic left renal cyst. Pelvic CT showed abnormal lower uterine segment/endocervical tissue.
- 4 weeks prior: Exploratory laparotomy with radical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy performed after abnormal endometrial curettage (moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma).
- During surgery: A mass in the mid-descending colon was discovered and hemicolectomy with colostomy was performed along with omentectomy, pelvic lymph-node dissection, and appendectomy.

## Pathology and staging
- Endometrium: Moderately differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (endometrioid subtype) with squamous metaplasia — grade 1 of 3. Tumor centered in the lower uterine segment, invaded the inner half of the myometrium. Immunohistochemistry: estrogen- and progesterone-receptor positive; vimentin positive; carcinoembryonic antigen negative. FIGO stage IB. Lymph nodes negative.
- Ovaries: Bilateral clear-cell adenofibromas of borderline malignancy with endometriosis (each <1 cm), no invasive carcinoma identified.
- Colon: Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the descending colon, 2.5 cm (invading into superficial muscularis propria), with prominent lymphocytic infiltrate and lymphoid aggregates; no lymphovascular invasion or nodal metastases identified — pathologic stage II. Closest resection margin 1.1 cm.
- Pelvic washings: Negative for carcinoma.

## Molecular/genomic testing
- Germline testing: Direct genetic testing of peripheral-blood leukocytes revealed a germ-line mutation in MSH2: 942+3A→T (reported in the NEJM case text). This is a splice-site alteration reported as a germline MSH2 mutation in the case report.
- Somatic tumor testing: The original case report does not provide next-generation sequencing read depth or variant allele fraction (VAF) data for the MSH2 allele in tumor tissue. As the MSH2 alteration was detected in peripheral blood as a germline variant, a heterozygous germline variant would be expected to have a VAF of approximately 50% in leukocyte DNA; specific VAF/read-depth values were not reported.
- Microsatellite instability (MSI) / mismatch-repair (MMR) protein data: The NEJM case text links the clinical presentation to Lynch syndrome (germline MSH2 mutation). While immunohistochemical and MSI test results are not explicitly reported in the available NEJM text excerpts, MSH2 germline pathogenic variants are associated with MSH2/MSH6 protein loss by IHC and MSI-high status in tumors.

## Biomarkers
- Endometrial tumor: ER/PR positive by IHC (reported).
- CA-125: 88.8 U/mL (elevated; ref 0–35).
- No reported PD-L1, FISH, or formal TMB/MSI numeric values in the original case report text.

## Prior treatments, responses, and toxicities
- Index surgeries: Radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; hemicolectomy with colostomy; omentectomy; pelvic lymph-node dissection; appendectomy.
- No neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic therapy was reported at the time of the case presentation. No treatment-related toxicities are reported in the case text.

## Current performance status and organ function (at time of report)
- Performance status not explicitly quantified in the report; patient able to undergo major abdominal surgery and return for genetic evaluation — generally consistent with ECOG 0–1 at presentation.
- Preoperative labs and chest CT: normal complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and renal tests; TSH elevated (6.56 μU/mL) consistent with known hypothyroidism on replacement therapy; hCG <6 IU/L.

## Clinical considerations and implications
- The constellation of synchronous endometrial and colorectal cancers in a woman with a strong maternal family history and a germline MSH2 splice-site mutation is diagnostic of Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer due to MSH2 pathogenic variant). This has implications for cancer surveillance, risk-reducing surgery (consideration of risk-reducing hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for confirmed carriers after childbearing), and cascade genetic testing for relatives.
- MSI-H/dMMR status (expected given germline MSH2 mutation) confers predictive sensitivity to PD-1 blockade for unresectable/metastatic solid tumors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab), and impacts adjuvant chemotherapy considerations in early-stage colon cancer (reduced benefit from adjuvant single-agent 5-FU in stage II MSI-H disease).

## Q1 (015_1)

Given the documented germline MSH2 splice-site mutation (942+3A→T) detected in peripheral-blood leukocytes, what are the expected mismatch-repair (MMR) protein immunohistochemistry and microsatellite-instability (MSI) findings in this patient’s tumors, and what is the biological mechanism by which this variant predisposes to synchronous endometrial and colorectal cancers?

### Answer 1

A pathogenic splice-site alteration in MSH2 (942+3A→T) is expected to result in abnormal splicing of MSH2 mRNA leading to loss of functional MSH2 protein; consequently, tumor IHC typically demonstrates loss of MSH2 protein expression with concurrent loss of MSH6, and tumors commonly exhibit high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-High). The biological mechanism is loss of DNA mismatch-repair activity (with a somatic second hit in tumor tissue such as LOH, somatic mutation, or promoter inactivation), leading to accumulation of frameshift and indel mutations at microsatellite loci and increased mutational burden that predisposes to colorectal and endometrial carcinogenesis.

## Q2 (015_2)

This patient’s colon tumor invaded the superficial muscularis propria (pathologic stage II) with no lymphovascular invasion and negative lymph nodes; given the MSH2 germline mutation and likely MSI-High status, should adjuvant chemotherapy be recommended, and which regimen is preferred according to contemporary guideline-anchored evidence?

### Answer 2

For a resected stage II colon cancer without high-risk pathological features (no LVI, negative nodes, adequate margin) and with MSI-High/dMMR status (or Lynch syndrome), routine adjuvant single-agent fluoropyrimidine (5-FU) is not recommended because MSI-High stage II tumors derive little or no benefit from single-agent 5-FU; therefore, observation is appropriate. If high-risk features were present, an oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant regimen (e.g., FOLFOX) may be considered per NCCN. In this patient (T2, no high-risk features), no adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended.

---

## Q3 (015_3)

For this patient’s stage IB (FIGO) grade-1 endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (lower uterine segment, inner half myometrial invasion) that is ER/PR positive and node-negative after hysterectomy and BSO, is adjuvant therapy indicated and what follow-up/surveillance would you recommend specific to Lynch-syndrome carriers?

### Answer 3

For stage IB, grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer with inner-half myometrial invasion and negative nodes, no adjuvant chemotherapy or external-beam radiotherapy is typically required; vaginal-vault brachytherapy may be considered for select intermediate-risk cases but is not routinely indicated for low-risk grade-1 disease. For a confirmed MSH2 carrier, cascade testing, intensified colonoscopic surveillance, and discussion of Lynch-related surveillance and risk-reducing strategies for relatives are indicated. The patient already underwent hysterectomy and BSO, which is the recommended risk-reducing approach for unaffected carriers after childbearing.

---

## Q4 (015_4)

Given the patient’s confirmed MSH2 germline pathogenic variant and reproductive history, what are the recommended cascade testing and screening recommendations for first-degree relatives, and at what age should colonoscopic surveillance begin for confirmed MSH2 carriers in this family?

### Answer 4

All at-risk first-degree relatives should be offered targeted testing for the family-specific MSH2 pathogenic variant (942+3A→T). For confirmed MSH2 carriers, colonoscopic surveillance typically begins at age 20–25 years (or 2–5 years earlier than the youngest CRC in the family) and is repeated every 1–2 years. Risk-reducing hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy are recommended after completion of childbearing. Lifelong surveillance for other Lynch-associated malignancies should follow published guidelines.

---

## Q5 (015_5)

If this patient develops unresectable or metastatic disease of either colon or endometrial origin in the future, which systemic therapy is preferred based on mismatch-repair deficiency, and what regulatory precedent supports this choice?

### Answer 5

Immune-checkpoint inhibition with an anti–PD-1 antibody (for example, pembrolizumab) is a preferred systemic therapy for unresectable/metastatic MSI-High/dMMR solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment; pembrolizumab received tissue-agnostic accelerated approval from the FDA in 2017 for MSI-High/dMMR solid tumors. Other PD-1 inhibitors with evidence in MSI-H/dMMR tumors may also be appropriate depending on availability and indication.

---

## Q6 (015_6)

Describe how the expected germline heterozygous status of MSH2 (detected in peripheral blood) would present in variant allele fraction (VAF) on germline testing and how tumor sequencing might demonstrate the second hit; include expected VAF ranges and mechanisms of somatic inactivation relevant to this patient.

### Answer 6

A heterozygous germline pathogenic MSH2 variant in leukocyte DNA typically shows a VAF of ~45–55% (approx. 50%) depending on assay read depth and quality. In tumor tissue, somatic inactivation (second hit) may occur via LOH, somatic point/nonsense mutation, or promoter hypermethylation (less common for MSH2 than MLH1), producing biallelic loss. LOH or clonal selection can increase the VAF of the pathogenic allele in tumor sequencing (often markedly >50%, approaching clonal levels), or a second somatic MSH2 mutation can be demonstrated. Read-depth and copy-number analysis help characterize LOH.

## Q7 (015_7)

How should this patient’s elevated CA-125 (88.8 U/mL) be interpreted in the context of her ovarian pathology (bilateral clear-cell adenofibromas of borderline malignancy) and synchronous endometrial and colon cancers, and how would CA-125 influence post-operative surveillance plans?

### Answer 7

CA-125 is nonspecific and can be elevated in benign and malignant gynecologic and non-gynecologic conditions. In this patient, CA-125 elevation may reflect pelvic pathology or peritoneal inflammation; borderline ovarian tumors may or may not raise CA-125. CA-125 alone is insufficient for surveillance of Lynch-associated cancers; follow-up should rely on guideline-directed history/physical exams, colonoscopic surveillance, and imaging as indicated. CA-125 may be trended if initially elevated but should not replace standard surveillance measures.

## Q8 (015_8)

If the patient later presents with metastatic colorectal disease and tissue NGS indicates continued dMMR/MSI-High with very high TMB, how should systemic therapy be sequenced relative to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and what evidence supports the use of immunotherapy in the frontline setting for MSI-H metastatic CRC?

### Answer 8

For metastatic MSI-High/dMMR colorectal cancer, checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab) have shown high response rates and durable responses and are considered a frontline option for patients who do not require immediate cytoreduction. If rapid tumor shrinkage is required (symptomatic or high tumor burden), cytotoxic chemotherapy ± targeted agents may be used first. Clinical trials (KEYNOTE series) and guideline updates support frontline pembrolizumab for MSI-H metastatic CRC in appropriate patients.

## Q9 (015_9)

Considering the synchronous presentation of colorectal and endometrial cancers in a patient with a maternal family history of Lynch-associated tumors and a confirmed MSH2 splicing mutation, what is the likelihood that this family meets Amsterdam II or revised Bethesda criteria, and how would that affect genetic testing strategy for relatives?

### Answer 9

The family history (proband with CRC and endometrial cancer at 46; mother with endometrial cancer at 50; maternal grandfather with CRC at 55) is strongly suggestive of Lynch syndrome and likely meets revised Bethesda guidelines or raises high suspicion under Amsterdam criteria pending exact pedigree detail. Given the confirmed pathogenic MSH2 variant in the proband, the recommended strategy is targeted single-site testing for at-risk relatives for the known familial MSH2 variant, which is cost-effective and definitive for cascade testing.

## Q10 (015_10)

For clinical trial matching and advanced precision-medicine planning, which trial eligibility features (biomarker and clinical) make this patient an ideal candidate for basket or tissue-agnostic studies, and which real-world regulatory approval underpins such trial designs?

### Answer 10

The patient’s confirmed germline MSH2 pathogenic variant and expected tumor dMMR/MSI-High phenotype make her an ideal candidate for MSI-H/dMMR-directed basket or tissue-agnostic immunotherapy trials. Key eligibility features include documented MSI-H/dMMR by IHC/PCR/validated NGS, measurable disease, ECOG 0–1, and adequate organ function. The FDA’s 2017 tissue-agnostic accelerated approval of pembrolizumab for MSI-H/dMMR solid tumors provides the regulatory precedent and rationale for tissue-agnostic trial designs.
