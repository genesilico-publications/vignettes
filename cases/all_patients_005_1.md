## Case

# Case vignette: Case 17-2024 — A 45-Year-Old Woman with Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer

## Demographics and relevant history
- Age/sex: 45-year-old woman.
- Past medical history: Depression. No tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. Penicillin allergy (rash).
- Family history: Maternal grandmother died of leukemia; paternal grandfather died of prostate cancer. Germline testing: no pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants reported.

## Initial presentation and early-stage therapy (chronologic)
- Approximately 6 years before current presentation: patient noted a right-breast mass.
- Diagnostic workup: mammography and ultrasonography; core-needle biopsy revealed invasive ductal carcinoma.
- Surgery: lumpectomy with sentinel-node biopsy; pathology: invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3, 2.5 cm, no lymphovascular invasion, 3 sentinel nodes negative.
- Receptor status on primary tumor: ER negative, PR weakly positive (<5%), HER2 negative (IHC interpreted as consistent with triple-negative by reporting team).
- Adjuvant therapy: adriamycin (doxorubicin) + cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel; adjuvant radiation to the right breast.
- Surveillance: no recurrence for 3.5 years after adjuvant therapy.

## Emergence of metastatic disease and neurologic symptoms
- Timeline to metastasis: Neurologic transient episodes (left-arm weakness and numbness) began 18 months before current presentation and recurred more frequently over 4 weeks, prompting ED evaluation and imaging.
- Brain MRI: right precentral gyrus partially cystic mass (~3.5 cm) with peripheral enhancement and mass effect; subsequent imaging showed multiple small new enhancing lesions (eg, 3 mm right occipital) and later additional small lesions (eg, 7 mm right superior frontal gyrus; later new left precentral gyrus 6 mm and others).
- Management of brain disease: right frontal craniotomy with resection of dominant lesion; pathology consistent with poorly differentiated metastatic carcinoma compatible with breast primary (GATA-3 patchy positivity). Stereotactic radiosurgery to several small lesions; later whole-brain radiation for progression.

## Thoracic disease and pulmonary findings
- PET–CT: active, FDG-avid conglomerate lymph-node mass in the right perihilar region encasing the right upper-lobe bronchus and causing bronchial narrowing; by later imaging it progressed to occlude the bronchus of the right middle lobe and severely narrow the right superior pulmonary vein.
- Bronchoscopy: right middle lobe completely obstructed by mass effect; BAL cytology and cultures negative for infection; transbronchial biopsies nondiagnostic for alveolated lung tissue in the targeted nodules; core biopsy of a right upper-lobe mass showed poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with metastatic breast cancer (GATA-3 patchy positivity, ER/PR negative, HER2 IHC 1+).

## Pathology and molecular testing
- Brain metastasis (resected): poorly differentiated carcinoma, high mitotic activity, patchy GATA-3 positivity, ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2 IHC 1+, PD-L1 <1% (IHC), consistent with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (HER2-low by IHC 1+ but ISH not amplified and therefore HER2-low category rather than HER2-positive).
- Next-generation sequencing (tumor panel): reported variants in FOXL2, CCND3, TP53, and FLT3. The report did not provide variant allele fractions (VAFs) or read depths in the clinical narrative provided; no copy-number amplification of HER2 reported; RNA fusion assay negative.
- Biomarkers not performed / not reported: Trop-2 IHC not assessed; PD-L1 low (<1%); HER2 IHC = 1+ (HER2-low by IHC criteria, no ISH amplification described).

## Prior metastatic systemic therapies and responses
- First-line metastatic therapy (after metastatic diagnosis): capecitabine — subsequently discontinued for progression.
- Clinical trial therapy: oral paclitaxel (NCT03326102) — continued for months with some intracranial progression managed by stereotactic radiosurgery.
- Subsequent systemic therapy lines included sacituzumab govitecan (Trop-2 ADC) — patient received sacituzumab govitecan for 10 months with objective benefit (radiographic decrease in perihilar mass by CT/PET and intracranial disease control for a period).
- After progression, the patient received trastuzumab deruxtecan (HER2-directed ADC targeting HER2-low disease) for 6 months. Early during therapy new clustered pulmonary nodules and ground-glass opacities developed; treatment was interrupted and then restarted after pulmonary evaluation (bronchoscopy, BAL, biopsy). Ultimately trastuzumab deruxtecan was discontinued after disease progression in the brain and enlargement of the perihilar mass.
- Later treatments: additional lines of chemotherapy, enrollment in a trial combining immunotherapy + PARP inhibitor + radiation (NCT04837209), whole-brain radiotherapy for progressive intracranial disease, further chemotherapy for extracranial progression.

## Toxicities and complications
- Respiratory: chronic dry cough preceded ADC therapy and persisted; after trastuzumab deruxtecan new ground-glass opacities and clustered nodules were detected on CT; bronchoscopy and BAL were nondiagnostic for infection or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The clinical team considered but did not definitively confirm drug-induced ILD; trastuzumab deruxtecan was transiently interrupted and then restarted, later stopped due to disease progression.
- Hematologic: no specific severe cytopenias documented in the narrative; however ADCs used have recognized hematologic toxicity profiles.
- Neurologic: recurrent seizures/neurologic deficits from brain metastases that resolved after resection and were later treated with radiosurgery and whole-brain RT.
- Other: patient later experienced hip fracture after fall requiring surgery; cause of death 8 years after initial diagnosis was COVID-19 during chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression.

## Current performance status and organ function at presentation to tertiary center
- Vital signs stable; oxygen saturation 98% on room air. No hypoxemia with ambulation at pulmonary clinic visit. Spirometry suggested obstruction with hyperinflation; diffusing capacity (DLCO) was reported normal. CBC, creatinine, electrolytes, and liver transaminases were within normal limits at the visit documented.

## Key clinical impressions
- Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (primary tumor and metastases ER-/PR-/HER2 IHC 1+), HER2-low by IHC but HER2 nonamplified by ISH when performed/noted.
- Multi-site metastatic disease: brain (multiple metastases) and thoracic nodal mass causing airway obstruction and venous narrowing.
- Tumor genomics: somatic alterations reported (FOXL2, CCND3, TP53, FLT3) without VAF/read-depth reporting in the case narrative; no actionable high-level amplifications (eg, HER2 amplification) reported.

## Relevant clinical decision points illustrated by this case
- Selection and sequencing of antibody–drug conjugates (sacituzumab govitecan followed by trastuzumab deruxtecan) for metastatic triple-negative, HER2-low disease after multiple prior systemic therapies.
- Management of suspected ADC-associated pulmonary toxicity (evaluation with CT, bronchoscopy/BAL, PFTs; considerations for corticosteroids and interruption/cessation based on grade/severity per product labeling and guideline recommendations).
- Consideration of intracranial disease control strategies in TNBC with brain metastases (surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, whole-brain radiation, and systemic therapy choices with intracranial penetrance).

## Q1 (005_1)

Given this patient’s tumor is ER-/PR-/HER2 IHC 1+ (HER2-low by IHC) with progressive extracranial disease after 10 months of sacituzumab govitecan and ongoing brain metastases, is trastuzumab deruxtecan an appropriate systemic therapy option and what factors specific to this patient would modify that recommendation?

### Answer 1

Yes. DESTINY-Breast04 and subsequent data support trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) for patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer after prior chemotherapy; exploratory data and small intracranial series suggest intracranial activity after local therapy. Patient-specific modifiers: HER2 IHC 1+ meets the HER2-low category; prior benefit with sacituzumab govitecan does not preclude T-DXd because different antigen targets (Trop-2 vs HER2) and available data support sequential ADC use; however, substantial ILD/pneumonitis risk from T-DXd (monitor closely and consider baseline pulmonary status, prior thoracic radiation and existing bronchial obstruction) and presence of brain metastases requires evaluation of intracranial disease control and multidisciplinary planning.

---

## Q2 (005_2)

How should the treating team have incorporated UGT1A1 pharmacogenomic information into the management of sacituzumab govitecan for this patient, and would UGT1A1 testing have changed the dosing or supportive-care approach given her clinical course?

### Answer 2

The TRODELVY label notes increased risk of severe neutropenia and anemia in patients with reduced UGT1A1 activity (eg, *28/*28 homozygotes). Routine UGT1A1 testing is not mandatory but can inform anticipatory supportive-care (more frequent CBC monitoring, consideration of prophylactic G-CSF for high-risk genotypes, and readiness to dose-reduce or interrupt for cytopenias per label). For this patient, if UGT1A1 homozygosity had been identified, clinicians should have had a lower threshold for G-CSF and early dose modification; the case narrative does not report severe cytopenias.

---

## Q3 (005_3)

With progressive brain metastases despite prior resection, SRS and later whole-brain RT, what systemic therapy choices are guideline- or evidence-supported for intracranial disease control in a patient with HER2-low, PD-L1 <1% metastatic TNBC, and how do the patient’s biomarker results influence eligibility for pembrolizumab or other immunotherapy?

### Answer 3

Systemic options with evidence for intracranial activity include cytotoxic chemotherapy with CNS penetration, and trastuzumab deruxtecan has shown intracranial activity in HER2-positive and HER2-low settings in small series/trials (TUXEDO-1, DEBBRAH) and preclinical models. Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy is indicated in first-line metastatic TNBC only for PD-L1 CPS ≥10 (KEYNOTE-355) and is not indicated here with PD-L1 <1%. Trial enrollment for CNS-active ADCs or targeted agents is reasonable.

---

## Q4 (005_4)

Should the care team perform a repeat tissue biopsy and comprehensive genomic profiling at this point in the patient’s course, and which specific tests (including assays and biomarkers such as HER2 ISH, Trop-2 IHC, PD-L1 CPS, and broad NGS with VAF/read-depth reporting) would directly inform precision-therapy choices for this patient?

### Answer 4

Yes. Repeat biopsy and comprehensive NGS (with allele fraction and read-depth reporting), HER2 ISH to confirm nonamplified status, PD-L1 CPS if immunotherapy is considered, and Trop-2 expression assessment are reasonable. NGS may detect acquired resistance or new actionable alterations; because prior report lacked VAF/read-depth, repeat testing on a progressing extracranial lesion is indicated to guide therapy or trial matching.

---

## Q5 (005_5)

Nine weeks after starting trastuzumab deruxtecan the patient had new ground-glass opacities and clustered nodules on CT with no clear infectious cause; what is the evidence-based, drug-specific management algorithm for suspected T-DXd–associated interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis in this patient, and how would radiographic grade and symptoms guide continuation versus permanent discontinuation?

### Answer 5

Follow the Enhertu label: promptly interrupt therapy for suspected ILD/pneumonitis and evaluate. Grade 1 (asymptomatic) — interrupt until resolved to grade 0 and consider resuming if resolved within the timeframe specified in the label with close monitoring; Grade 2 or higher — permanently discontinue and initiate systemic corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 1 mg/kg or equivalent with taper). For severe cases, hospitalize and manage aggressively. In this patient the observed imaging changes and mild dyspnea warranted interruption and pulmonary evaluation; permanent discontinuation would be required for Grade ≥2.

---

## Q6 (005_6)

How should the bronchial obstruction from the right perihilar nodal mass and severe narrowing of the right superior pulmonary vein be managed in a patient who is not a candidate for airway stenting, and how do those local therapy choices integrate with systemic therapy selection and safety monitoring for ADC-related pulmonary risks?

### Answer 6

Management requires a multidisciplinary approach including consideration of palliative external-beam radiation therapy to relieve obstruction, bronchoscopic debulking or ablative techniques if feasible, and supportive measures. Given ADC-associated pulmonary risks, coordinate timing of thoracic radiation and ADC administration, with heightened ILD monitoring if ADC is resumed after thoracic radiation. In the reported case, stenting was not feasible and local radiation was used as part of management and trial therapy.

---

## Q7 (005_7)

Does the patient’s low PD-L1 (<1%) preclude use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in later-line settings or trial enrollment, and how should PD-L1 testing (assay type and scoring) be interpreted for eligibility decisions?

### Answer 7

PD-L1 CPS <1 precludes the approved frontline pembrolizumab + chemotherapy indication (CPS ≥10). Low PD-L1 does not completely exclude trial enrollment in later-line or combination strategies but reduces the likelihood of benefit from single-agent checkpoint inhibitors. When evaluating eligibility, ensure PD-L1 is reported by the assay and scoring method required by the trial (eg, CPS vs TPS).

---

## Q8 (005_8)

The patient’s tumor NGS reported FOXL2, CCND3, TP53, and FLT3 variants without VAF or read-depth data. How does the lack of VAF/read-depth reporting limit clinical interpretation, and are any of these variants actionable in the context of metastatic TNBC for FDA-approved or guideline-endorsed targeted therapy?

### Answer 8

VAF and read depth are essential to assess clonality and to distinguish subclonal or low-level variants from artifacts; lack of these metrics limits confidence in clinical actionability. TP53 is commonly mutated in TNBC but not directly targetable with approved drugs; FLT3-targeted agents are approved in AML, not breast cancer; CCND3 and FOXL2 findings are not indications for approved breast-cancer targeted therapies. Thus, none of these variants alone support an FDA-approved targeted therapy in TNBC; repeat testing with full reporting and copy-number assessment is reasonable to search for actionable alterations and for trial matching.

---

## Q9 (005_9)

After progression on sacituzumab govitecan and trastuzumab deruxtecan, what is the current evidence and expert rationale for sequential ADC therapy in metastatic breast cancer, and what are the key biologic mechanisms that could underlie cross-resistance or retained sensitivity in sequential ADC use?

### Answer 9

Sequential ADC use has observational and early-phase support: when the second ADC targets a different antigen (eg, Trop-2 vs HER2), responses can occur despite prior ADC exposure. Mechanisms of resistance include antigen loss or down-regulation, payload-target mutations (eg, TOP1 alterations), altered lysosomal trafficking, and drug efflux. Because sacituzumab govitecan and trastuzumab deruxtecan target different antigens but both deliver topoisomerase I inhibitors, cross-resistance is possible via payload-related mechanisms but is not inevitable; prospective data are limited, and trial enrollment for ADC sequencing is preferred.

---

## Q10 (005_10)

Which clinical trials or targeted-therapy strategies would be highest-priority matches for this patient today (assuming adequate performance status), considering HER2-low status, prior ADC exposure, brain metastases, and lack of actionable driver mutations on the reported panel?

### Answer 10

Priority matches include: (a) trials of HER2-directed therapies in HER2-low disease with CNS cohorts (eg, DESTINY brain cohorts, DEBBRAH/TUXEDO intracranial T-DXd studies); (b) trials of alternative ADCs targeting different antigens (eg, datopotamab deruxtecan / TROPION studies) and sequencing ADC trials; and (c) early-phase trials combining CNS-penetrant agents or novel payload/linker ADCs. Given PD-L1 <1% and absent BRCA, immune monotherapy or PARP monotherapy is less likely to be beneficial outside trials. Prioritize trials with CNS-active arms.
