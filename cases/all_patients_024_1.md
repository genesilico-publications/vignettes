## Case

# Case vignette: A 71-year-old woman with high‑risk, recurrent high‑grade serous ovarian carcinoma

## Demographics and relevant history
- Age/sex: 71-year-old woman.
- Relevant medical history: Hypertension (controlled on a thiazide). No reported germline BRCA mutation (BRCA wild-type on prior germline testing). No other reported hereditary cancer syndrome.

## Initial cancer presentation and management (2017)
- Presentation: Diagnosed in 2017 with epithelial high‑grade serous ovarian carcinoma; disease distribution consistent with stage IVa at diagnosis (per document). 
- Surgery: Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo‑oophorectomy (TAH/BSO) and lymph node dissection; suboptimal cytoreduction with residual tumor >1 cm within the peritoneal cavity.
- Adjuvant therapy: Carboplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab (6 cycles) followed by maintenance bevacizumab.
- Response: Achieved a complete response on bevacizumab maintenance.

## First recurrence and diagnostic workup (~2 years after surgery)
- Presentation: ~2 years after initial surgery and completion of frontline therapy the patient developed progressive fatigue and abdominal pain; CA‑125 elevated to 456 U/mL.
- Imaging: Contrast CT chest/abdomen/pelvis showed suspicious lung lesions.
- Pathology: Biopsy of lung lesion confirmed recurrent high‑grade serous ovarian carcinoma (metastatic to lung).

## Molecular/genomic testing and biomarkers
- Germline testing: BRCA wild‑type (no germline BRCA mutation reported).
- Tumor testing: HRD‑positive based on high genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH); no other actionable alterations were reported in the document.
- Specific numeric genomic metrics (VAF, read depth, exact LOH percentage) and other biomarkers (PD‑L1 IHC, FISH, MSI, TMB) were not reported in the source document.

## Second‑line systemic treatment for recurrence
- Because the disease was platinum‑sensitive (interval ≥6 months since prior platinum), she received carboplatin plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) for 4 cycles.
- Response: CA‑125 declined to 35 U/mL after chemotherapy and later became undetectable; interval imaging after 4 cycles showed no gross masses or lymphadenopathy.

## Maintenance therapy and follow‑up
- The source document contains inconsistent dosing details for rucaparib maintenance:
  - Page 2 reports "single‑agent rucaparib at 600 mg orally twice daily." (This matches the initial ARIEL3/Rubraca-approved dosing.)
  - Page 3 reports initiation of rucaparib 300 mg twice daily. (Likely reflects a dose reduction or reporting discrepancy; the primary approved starting dose is 600 mg twice daily per FDA label.)
- Current ECOG performance status: 0.
- At 2‑month follow‑up on maintenance rucaparib (per document):
  - CA‑125 undetectable.
  - CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: no radiographic evidence of gross disease.
  - Pelvic exam: unremarkable.

## Current problems and missing data
- Active issues: patient is on PARP inhibitor maintenance with good clinical status and biochemical/radiographic remission.
- Missing but clinically relevant data not provided in the source document: exact LOH percentage or assay used (e.g., FoundationOne CDx LOH score), tumor BRCA somatic testing results (if performed), VAF/read depth for any somatic variants, baseline hematologic/renal/hepatic function values, and details of prior toxicities to platinum or bevacizumab.

## Q1 (024_1)

Given this patient’s tumor is HRD-positive by high genomic LOH but she is germline BRCA wild-type, what is the evidence-based rationale for selecting rucaparib maintenance after a platinum-sensitive response, and does the ARIEL3 evidence support benefit in HRD-high/BRCAwt tumors?

### Answer 1

ARIEL3 demonstrated a statistically significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit for rucaparib 600 mg orally twice daily versus placebo as maintenance in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent high-grade ovarian carcinoma who had responded to platinum chemotherapy. The trial showed benefit in the prespecified subgroups including BRCA‑mutant, HRD‑high (defined by genomic LOH), and the intention-to-treat population; patients with BRCAwt but HRD‑high tumors derived clinically meaningful PFS improvement supporting rucaparib maintenance in HRD-high/BRCAwt patients. Thus, rucaparib maintenance is evidence‑based for this patient’s profile.

---

## Q2 (024_2)

The source document reports two different rucaparib dosings (600 mg BID and 300 mg BID). What is the appropriate starting dose for maintenance rucaparib in this patient, and how should dosing be adjusted for toxicity or age-related factors?

### Answer 2

The approved starting dose for rucaparib maintenance per the FDA label and ARIEL3 trial is 600 mg orally twice daily. Dose reductions are recommended for toxicity per label (stepwise reductions to 500 mg BID, then 400 mg BID, etc., per tolerability). Age alone (71 years) with ECOG 0 is not an automatic indication to reduce starting dose; dosing adjustments should be based on organ function (renal/hepatic), concomitant interacting drugs, and observed toxicities (especially anemia, AST/ALT elevations). Close monitoring of blood counts and chemistries in older patients is prudent.

## Q3 (024_3)

How would the absence of a reported tumor BRCA (somatic) test and absence of numerical LOH metrics (percent LOH, VAF/read depth) alter interpretation of HRD status and clinical decision-making for PARP inhibitor maintenance in this patient?

### Answer 3

HRD designation in ARIEL3 used genomic LOH as a surrogate; however, precise LOH percentage and assay method (e.g., FoundationOne CDx LOH algorithm) affect reproducibility and predictive value. In the absence of a reported somatic BRCA test or LOH percentage, one must confirm the tumor assay used and threshold (ARIEL trials prospectively used a defined LOH cutoff to identify HRD-high). If the tumor was HRD-positive per an accredited assay used in ARIEL3/labeling, that supports rucaparib use. If assay details are unavailable, consider re‑testing tumor tissue (including somatic BRCA and validated HRD assay) when results would alter management. VAF/read depth are informative for clonal interpretation but are not required to make the maintenance decision if validated HRD-positive status is documented.

## Q4 (024_4)

For this specific patient (ECOG 0, prior bevacizumab exposure, suboptimally debulked stage IVa at diagnosis), would combining a PARP inhibitor with bevacizumab be supported by the evidence in the recurrent maintenance setting, and would that change your recommendation?

### Answer 4

Data supporting PARP inhibitor + bevacizumab comes primarily from the first-line maintenance PAOLA‑1 trial (olaparib + bevacizumab) showing PFS benefit in HRD-positive first-line patients. In the recurrent maintenance setting after a response to platinum, randomized evidence for rucaparib + bevacizumab specifically is limited. Therefore, while PARP + antiangiogenic combination is biologically plausible and supported in first-line HRD-positive disease (PAOLA‑1 with olaparib), the evidence base does not specifically mandate changing from single-agent rucaparib in this recurrent maintenance scenario; single-agent rucaparib per ARIEL3 is guideline‑supported. For considering combination therapy in recurrence, enrollment in a clinical trial or use guided by available evidence and patient comorbidities is appropriate.

## Q5 (024_5)

If this patient subsequently develops progression on rucaparib maintenance after 10 months with a new pleural metastasis and a rebiopsy demonstrates a new BRCA2 reversion mutation at 12% VAF (read depth 500x), how would you interpret this result and what therapeutic options should be prioritized?

### Answer 5

A BRCA2 reversion mutation detected in tumor tissue at 12% VAF (with adequate read depth of 500x) is strongly suggestive of acquired resistance to PARP inhibitor therapy by restoration of homologous recombination. This mechanism predicts reduced likelihood of benefit from further PARP inhibitor monotherapy. Therapeutic priorities include switching to non‑PARP systemic therapy (e.g., platinum‑based chemotherapy if still platinum‑sensitive, consideration of clinical trials targeting resistance mechanisms, or other systemic agents per guideline), and consideration of combination approaches (e.g., PARP + agent that may overcome resistance) only within clinical trials. Where somatic reversion is present, cytotoxic chemotherapy (platinum if sensitivity retained) or enrollment in trials of novel agents (ATR, POLQ inhibitors, immune combinations) is recommended.

## Q6 (024_6)

Considering this patient’s age (71) and prior exposure to bevacizumab and platinum, what baseline and ongoing monitoring (lab tests and intervals) should be performed while she remains on rucaparib maintenance, and what toxicity signals would mandate immediate therapy hold or discontinuation?

### Answer 6

Baseline tests prior to initiating rucaparib should include CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel (including AST/ALT, bilirubin), renal function (creatinine), and a baseline ECG if clinically indicated. During therapy, CBC and chemistries should be monitored every 2–4 weeks for the first 2 months, then monthly for the next 4 months and periodically thereafter per label. Hold rucaparib for grade ≥3 nonhematologic toxicity or for clinically significant grade ≥3 hematologic toxicity (e.g., grade 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or prolonged grade ≥3 anemia), and follow dose modification guidelines in the prescribing information. New or worsening hypertension (given prior bevacizumab exposure) should be managed per standard guidelines but is not a typical rucaparib toxicity; coordinate with prior bevacizumab history.

---

## Q7 (024_7)

If the treating oncologist is considering maintenance treatment selection between rucaparib and olaparib for this patient with HRD‑positive, BRCAwt disease after response to platinum, what trial/guideline evidence should guide that choice and what patient factors would influence selection?

### Answer 7

Both rucaparib (ARIEL3) and olaparib (in applicable settings) have shown benefit in maintenance of platinum‑sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer; differences in trial populations, biomarker definitions, toxicity profiles, and regulatory approvals inform drug choice. ARIEL3 supports rucaparib 600 mg BID for maintenance across biomarker subgroups, including HRD-high BRCAwt. Olaparib has also shown benefit in similar contexts and is used in various maintenance settings (check specific label indications and biomarker requirements). Factors influencing selection include prior toxicity (e.g., prior hematologic toxicity), drug–drug interactions, tolerance to pill burden, concomitant medications, renal/hepatic function, and local formulary/access. For HRD-high BRCAwt, rucaparib is an evidence-based option per ARIEL3; however, guideline recommendations may allow multiple PARP inhibitors depending on availability and prior exposures.

## Q8 (024_8)

In this patient who had initial suboptimal debulking (>1 cm residual) and now a solitary lung metastasis at recurrence that responded to platinum, should surgical resection of the solitary lung lesion have been considered before systemic therapy, and would metastasectomy alter subsequent maintenance strategy?

### Answer 8

For isolated pulmonary metastases in ovarian carcinoma, metastasectomy can be considered in selected patients with limited disease, good performance status, and when complete resection is feasible; however, most recurrent platinum‑sensitive patients receive systemic platinum chemotherapy as standard, especially if there is concern for micrometastatic disease. Given this patient’s radiographic and biopsy-proven lung lesion and systemic nature of ovarian cancer, systemic platinum therapy followed by maintenance is guideline‑concordant. If a complete metastasectomy had been performed and the patient remained disease‑free, maintenance decisions would still rely on molecular risk (HRD status) and prior systemic therapies; PARP inhibitor maintenance could still be considered if criteria met. Decision should be individualized and made in a multidisciplinary tumor board.

## Q9 (024_9)

Design a trial‑matching recommendation for this patient if she desired participation in clinical research now while on rucaparib maintenance, specifying trial classes that would be appropriate and eligibility considerations given her biology (HRD-high, BRCAwt), prior bevacizumab exposure, ECOG 0, and age.

### Answer 9

Appropriate trial classes include (a) PARP inhibitor combinations to overcome resistance or deepen responses (e.g., PARP + ATR, PARP + immune checkpoint inhibitor), (b) trials of novel HRD‑targeting agents (POLQ inhibitors, RAD51 modulators), (c) antibody–drug conjugates or targeted agents for actionable non‑BRCA alterations if identified, and (d) trials of sequencing strategies for PARP re‑challenge or combination with antiangiogenics. Eligibility considerations: prior number of prior regimens, time from last platinum, organ function and marrow reserve, and concurrent PARP therapy (many trials require washout or progression on PARP to enroll). Given ECOG 0 and age 71, many trials would be open to her, but confirm comorbidity exclusions and prior bevacizumab exposure. Recommend searching clinicaltrials.gov for active trials of rucaparib combinations and HRD-targeted agents.

## Q10 (024_10)

Provide an evidence‑based plan for surveillance and criteria for stopping maintenance rucaparib and initiating subsequent therapy in this patient, incorporating CA‑125 trends, imaging findings, and clinical status.

### Answer 10

Surveillance while on maintenance typically includes periodic clinical visits, CA‑125 monitoring and interval CT imaging. Rising CA‑125 (confirmed and consistent with clinical/radiographic findings) or new/progressive lesions on imaging should prompt restaging and consideration of progression. Criteria to stop maintenance include radiographic progression per RECIST or symptomatic progression; biochemical progression alone warrants confirmatory imaging and clinical correlation before changing therapy. At confirmed progression, therapeutic options include platinum-based chemotherapy if platinum sensitivity persists, non‑platinum regimens if platinum-resistant, clinical trials, or targeted therapy if new actionable alterations are identified. Use guideline concordant intervals (e.g., CA‑125 every 1–3 months initially; imaging every 3 months or clinically indicated).
