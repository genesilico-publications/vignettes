## Case

# Case 25-2009 (NEJM Case 002) — Comprehensive Vignette

## Patient demographics and relevant history
- Age/sex: 36-year-old woman (premenopausal). 
- Ethnicity: Western European ancestry.
- Reproductive history: Nulliparous; menarche at 14. Intermittent oral-contraceptive use totaling ~10 years. No current partner; considering donor sperm for future fertility.
- Past medical/surgical history: Excisional biopsy of two enlarged right axillary lymph nodes (6 years earlier) reportedly reactive; arthroscopic repair of torn left medial meniscus 8 years earlier. No chronic medical problems.
- Family history: No family history of breast or ovarian cancer. BRCA1/BRCA2 germline testing: negative.
- Social: Student, non-smoker, <5 alcoholic drinks/week.
- Medications: Multivitamins, glucosamine/chondroitin. No allergies reported.

## Presentation and timeline
- ~3 months before presentation: Patient noticed a right-breast lump adjacent to the nipple.
- ~2 months after first noticing: Digital mammography showed heterogeneously dense breasts; no discrete mass. Targeted breast ultrasound revealed a right breast mass measuring 1.3 × 1.2 × 0.9 cm at 12 o'clock, 5 cm from the nipple. Patient initially declined same-day biopsy.
- 17 days later: Ultrasound-guided core biopsy performed. Pathology: invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 1 on initial biopsy; ER-positive, PR-positive, HER2-negative by IHC/FISH.
- 16 days after biopsy: Breast MRI with gadolinium showed a rim-enhancing mass in the upper inner quadrant of right breast (1.2 × 1.3 cm), ~6.3 cm from the nipple.
- 11 days later: Lumpectomy with sentinel-node mapping and biopsy (3 sentinel nodes excised). Frozen section: no metastasis. Final pathology: invasive ductal carcinoma 1.4 × 1.0 × 1.0 cm, grade 2/3, contiguous and separate foci of invasive carcinoma and extensive DCIS (solid and cribriform) extending to some margins. No lymphovascular invasion on permanent section. Tumor strongly ER-positive (>90% nuclei), PR-positive, HER2 IHC negative and FISH non-amplified.
- Sentinel-node ultradepth immunostains: small clusters ranging <0.2 mm (isolated tumor cells) to 1.8 mm (micrometastases) identified in deeper levels of 1 of 3 sentinel nodes — AJCC pN1mi classification.
- Multigene assays performed on tumor: MammaPrint (70-gene) = "low risk"; Oncotype DX (21-gene) recurrence score = 16 (reported as ~10% risk of distant recurrence at 10 years for node-negative disease).
- BRCA1/BRCA2 germline testing: negative.
- ~1 month after lumpectomy: Reexcision and right axillary dissection performed. Pathology: single 0.3-cm focus of DCIS (grade 1) on 1 of 10 slides; margins clear. Of 13 additional nodes, none positive.
- Adjuvant treatment chosen: Breast-conserving radiation to the right breast; adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression with leuprolide for 5 years. The patient pursued fertility preservation (embryo banking) prior to initiation of ovarian suppression and endocrine therapy and underwent controlled ovarian stimulation.
- Fertility-preservation details (from case): Standard stimulation protocol: FSH 150 IU + hMG 150 IU starting on cycle day 3; GnRH antagonist added on day 7; peak estradiol 2323 pg/mL on day 10; hCG trigger 10,000 IU; retrieval of 14 oocytes; 7 fertilized normally and were cryopreserved at the 2PN stage.
- Tolerability and response: The patient has menopausal symptoms from GnRH agonist but is otherwise well and disease-free at ~20 months of follow-up.

## Imaging
- Diagnostic mammography: Heterogeneously dense fibroglandular tissue limiting detection; metallic marker placed over palpable abnormality; no discrete mass visible on mammography.
- Targeted ultrasound: Slightly irregular, hypoechoic solid mass with irregular margins and posterior acoustic shadowing, measuring 1.3 × 1.2 × 0.9 cm at 12 o'clock.
- MRI (sagittal subtraction): Rim-enhancing 1.2 × 1.3 cm mass with internal nonenhancing core — imaging characteristics consistent with invasive carcinoma.

## Pathology
- Specimen: Lumpectomy specimen (final): invasive ductal carcinoma 1.4 × 1.0 × 1.0 cm; grade 2/3 on final pathology; multifocal DCIS (solid and cribriform) extending to margins on first excision but reexcised to clear margins.
- Hormone receptors: ER strongly positive (>90% nuclei), PR positive (quantitative percentage not given but positive by IHC).
- HER2: IHC negative; FISH no amplification.
- Lymph nodes: Sentinel node immunostains showed small clusters of tumor cells, up to 1.8 mm in deeper levels — classified as micrometastasis (pN1mi). Subsequent axillary dissection (13 non-sentinel nodes) negative.

## Molecular/genomic testing and biomarker data
- Germline testing: BRCA1/BRCA2 negative.
- Multigene assays:
  - Oncotype DX (21-gene): Recurrence score = 16. (Reported interpretation in case: ~10% risk of distant recurrence at 10 years in node-negative patients.) No VAF/read-depth data available (not applicable for these expression assays).
  - MammaPrint (70-gene): "Low risk" classification.
- No tumor sequencing for somatic mutations (e.g., PIK3CA, ESR1) reported in the NEJM case; no tumor VAF/read depth/copy-number or MSI/TMB data are reported.

## Prior treatments, responses, and toxicities
- Local therapy: Breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy with re-resection to clear margins) and sentinel-node biopsy → subsequent axillary dissection with no residual nodal disease on resection.
- Radiation: Adjuvant radiation to the right breast completed as per case.
- Endocrine therapy: Tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression with leuprolide planned for 5 years; patient tolerating with menopausal symptoms attributed to ovarian suppression (hot flashes, genitourinary symptoms); no major organ toxicities reported.
- Fertility-preservation intervention: Ovarian stimulation and embryo cryopreservation with retrieval of 14 oocytes and 7 embryos cryopreserved; peak estradiol 2323 pg/mL during stimulation. No immediate complications reported.

## Current performance status and organ function
- At time of last follow-up (~20 months): No evidence of recurrence. Performance status: clinically well (no explicit ECOG stated in case; normal vital signs and normal CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function tests were reported at baseline). Baseline labs all normal.

## Pathologic stage and final diagnoses (as per case)
- Pathologic stage: T1c (1.4 cm) pN1mi (micrometastasis in sentinel node) — AJCC stage II (per case authors).
- Tumor biology: Invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2/3, ER-positive, PR-positive, HER2-negative.
- DCIS: Concurrent ductal carcinoma in situ (solid and cribriform), one focus 0.3 cm on reexcision.

## Key clinical questions for this patient (summary)
- Does she require adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy in addition to endocrine therapy, given age (36, premenopausal), pN1mi, and a recurrence score of 16 with MammaPrint low-risk?
- Should ovarian suppression be added to tamoxifen (versus tamoxifen alone), and what is the evidence for benefit and harms in patients of this profile?
- What fertility-preservation strategies are recommended and what are the impacts of stimulation protocols on estrogen exposure and oncologic risk in ER-positive disease?

## Q1 (002_1)

In this 36-year-old premenopausal patient with ER+/PR+, HER2-negative invasive ductal carcinoma (T1c) with a sentinel-node micrometastasis (pN1mi), an Oncotype DX recurrence score of 16, and a MammaPrint "low-risk" result, should adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy be routinely recommended in addition to adjuvant endocrine therapy?

### Answer 1

Not routinely. Given concordant low genomic risk (MammaPrint low) and an Oncotype DX recurrence score in the low–intermediate range (16), plus the lower prognostic significance of micrometastatic nodal disease (pN1mi), contemporary evidence and guideline interpretation support omission of routine adjuvant chemotherapy and use of adjuvant endocrine therapy with ovarian suppression. Trials that guide chemotherapy decisions in node-positive disease (RxPONDER) showed a chemotherapy benefit in premenopausal women with 1–3 positive nodes overall, but micrometastatic disease was underrepresented and carries lower risk; therefore treatment should be individualized and omission of chemotherapy is reasonable for this patient.

---

## Q2 (002_2)

For this premenopausal woman who elected to avoid chemotherapy, does randomized evidence support adding ovarian suppression to tamoxifen (versus tamoxifen alone), and which regimen (tamoxifen + OFS vs. aromatase inhibitor + OFS) is supported by SOFT/TEXT data for a patient with her clinical profile?

### Answer 2

Yes. The SOFT/TEXT combined analyses demonstrated that adding ovarian suppression to tamoxifen reduces recurrence risk in certain premenopausal subgroups; exemestane + OFS produced superior disease-free outcomes compared with tamoxifen + OFS but with greater endocrine toxicity. For a young woman with relatively low genomic risk and pN1mi, tamoxifen + OFS is an evidence-based and guideline-appropriate choice; exemestane + OFS is an alternative when greater relative endocrine efficacy is desired and tolerability is acceptable.

## Q3 (002_3)

Did the patient’s embryo-banking cycle (standard stimulation, peak estradiol 2323 pg/mL, retrieval of 14 oocytes with 7 embryos cryopreserved) materially increase her risk of breast-cancer recurrence compared with using an estrogen-suppressed (letrozole-based) stimulation protocol, according to current evidence and guideline recommendations?

### Answer 3

Current evidence does not demonstrate a clear increase in breast-cancer recurrence risk from controlled ovarian stimulation for fertility preservation. Guidelines (ASCO) recommend offering fertility-preservation counseling and techniques; letrozole-based stimulation protocols are commonly used to minimize estrogen exposure in ER+ disease and are recommended where feasible, but absence of letrozole does not definitively prove increased oncologic risk. The patient's embryo banking as performed is consistent with contemporary practice.

---

## Q4 (002_4)

For this patient with sentinel-node micrometastasis (pN1mi) and subsequent axillary dissection showing no additional nodal metastases, does randomized evidence support omission of completion axillary lymph-node dissection without compromising locoregional control or survival?

### Answer 4

Yes. IBCSG 23-01 randomized trial demonstrated that in patients with sentinel-node micrometastases, omission of completion axillary dissection did not worsen outcomes, supporting less extensive axillary surgery for pN1mi when other management decisions (systemic therapy and radiation) are optimized.

---

## Q5 (002_5)

Should adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy be recommended to reduce the risk of bone recurrence and improve breast-cancer survival in this premenopausal patient receiving ovarian suppression?

### Answer 5

No routine indication in premenopausal patients. The EBCTCG meta-analysis showed reduction in bone recurrence and breast-cancer mortality with adjuvant bisphosphonates primarily in postmenopausal women. For premenopausal patients, bisphosphonates are not recommended for recurrence reduction unless the patient becomes postmenopausal (natural or treatment-induced) or has an independent skeletal indication.

---

## Q6 (002_6)

If this patient later develops metastatic, endocrine-resistant HR+/HER2- disease and tumor sequencing reveals a PIK3CA-activating mutation, is alpelisib plus fulvestrant an evidence-based option in the metastatic setting?

### Answer 6

Yes. The SOLAR-1 trial demonstrated that alpelisib plus fulvestrant improved progression-free survival in patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer after prior endocrine therapy; alpelisib is an evidence-based option in that metastatic context with careful toxicity monitoring (not an adjuvant therapy).

---

## Q7 (002_7)

Would adjuvant abemaciclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) plus endocrine therapy be indicated for this patient per the monarchE trial criteria?

### Answer 7

No. monarchE and approvals target node-positive, high-risk early breast cancer defined by specific clinicopathologic features (e.g., multiple positive nodes, larger tumor size, high grade, or Ki-67 ≥20% in some approvals). This patient has micrometastatic nodal disease (pN1mi), low genomic risk (MammaPrint low), and RS 16, and therefore does not meet typical monarchE high‑risk eligibility and is not an evidence-based candidate for adjuvant abemaciclib.

---

## Q8 (002_8)

If the patient wishes to attempt pregnancy after completing several years of endocrine therapy, does trial evidence support temporary interruption of endocrine therapy to attempt pregnancy without significantly increasing short-term recurrence risk?

### Answer 8

Emerging evidence from the POSITIVE trial suggests that temporary interruption of endocrine therapy to attempt pregnancy may be feasible and was not associated with a clear short-term increase in recurrence in interim analyses; however, decisions should be individualized and offered in a trial setting where possible, with multidisciplinary counseling.

---

## Q9 (002_9)

If the patient experiences severe menopausal symptoms or quality-of-life impairment from ovarian suppression, what is the recommended approach to endocrine therapy management?

### Answer 9

If OFS causes unacceptable toxicity, discontinuation of OFS with continuation of tamoxifen alone is an accepted approach; management should be individualized, balancing symptom control, bone-health monitoring, and recurrence risk. SOFT/TEXT data and guideline consensus support shared decision-making regarding OFS duration and tolerability.

---

## Q10 (002_10)

How should the treating oncologist integrate the Oncotype DX recurrence score of 16 and MammaPrint low-risk result when they provide overlapping prognostic information, and is there value to ordering both assays in contemporary practice for this case?

### Answer 10

Oncotype DX and MammaPrint interrogate overlapping biology (notably proliferation) and are often concordant; ordering both assays is typically redundant. Concordant low-risk results strengthen the rationale to omit chemotherapy and rely on endocrine therapy (plus OFS) in this patient. MINDACT and TAILORx inform the use of these assays; combining multiple tests rarely changes management beyond one validated assay.
