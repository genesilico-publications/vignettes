## Case

# Case vignette: Breast cancer–related lymphedema risk after lumpectomy and axillary-node dissection

## Brief clinical summary (chronologic)
- Demographics: 43-year-old perimenopausal woman; body-mass index (BMI) 29 (overweight, bordering on class I obesity). No other chronic comorbidities reported.
- Presentation and timeline: Recently diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. She underwent breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) with axillary lymph-node dissection; 12 axillary lymph nodes were removed, and the sentinel node was positive (only sentinel node positive). She is currently undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy. She reports no current arm symptoms and there is no detectable swelling on physical examination.
- Physical exam (documented): No detectable lymphedema at baseline; the vignette emphasizes a high-risk state because of axillary-node dissection and adjuvant radiotherapy.

## Pathology / surgical details
- Procedure: Lumpectomy and axillary lymph-node dissection; 12 nodes removed; tumor involvement reported in the sentinel node (number of positive nodes: 1 by implication). No further pathologic details (histologic subtype, grade) are provided in the source document.

## Systemic therapy / biomarkers / molecular testing
- The NEJM case report does not report any systemic therapy (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy) or tumor molecular profiling for this patient. There are therefore no reported somatic variants, VAFs, read depths, copy-number changes, or MSI/TMB results. Biomarker data (IHC, FISH, PD-L1) are not reported.

## Performance status and organ function
- The source document does not report formal ECOG or Karnofsky performance status; the patient is ambulatory and has no reported functional limitations or organ dysfunction. For clinical decision-making, she would be presumed to have good performance status (ECOG 0–1) and normal organ function unless otherwise documented.

## Risk factors for breast cancer–related lymphedema (patient-specific)
- Axillary lymph-node dissection (ALND) — major risk factor.
- Adjuvant radiotherapy (to breast ± regional nodes) — incremental risk factor.
- Positive nodal status (even a single positive sentinel node) — associated with higher risk than node-negative disease.
- Elevated BMI (29) — independent risk factor for lymphedema.
- No reported infection, wound complications, ipsilateral venous compromise, or taxane chemotherapy in the vignette (taxane exposure is a known risk factor if present).

## Recommended surveillance and early management strategy (as per NEJM review and concordant guidelines)
- Rationale: Most breast cancer–related lymphedema cases occur within 24 months; early detection allows less intensive and more effective interventions.
- Proposed surveillance for this patient: baseline assessment and serial objective monitoring during the first 12–24 months after surgery, with particular attention in the first year. The NEJM author recommends quarterly bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS; e.g., L-Dex) during the first year for this high-risk patient, with prompt initiation of compression and decongestive therapy for clinical or subclinical changes.
- If subclinical lymphedema is detected (BIS elevation above validated thresholds), options include short-course compression sleeve and targeted decongestive therapy with monitoring.
- Lifestyle interventions: weight reduction and maintenance strategies are recommended for patients with elevated BMI; progressive resistance exercise and aerobic activity are safe and may improve symptoms.

## Definitive and invasive interventions (indications and context)
- Microsurgical preventive approaches (e.g., LYMPHA performed at the time of ALND) have been reported to reduce incidence in nonrandomized series and early prospective studies; data are evolving and RCT-level evidence is limited.
- Debulking liposuction is an effective option for advanced, chronic lymphedema with adipose hypertrophy and fibrosis and requires lifelong compression after surgery.

## Data not available in the original report
- Tumor histology, grade, receptor status (ER/PR/HER2), systemic therapy details, laboratory/organ-function values, and any genetic test results are not provided and therefore considered not available.

## Q1 (009_1)

For this patient (ALND with 12 nodes removed, sentinel-node positive, BMI 29, currently receiving adjuvant radiotherapy), what objective surveillance strategy (modality and schedule) would you recommend during the first 24 months after surgery, and what thresholds would prompt early intervention for subclinical lymphedema?

### Answer 1

Recommendation: Obtain a baseline measurement within 2–4 weeks after surgery and perform serial surveillance approximately every 3 months during the first year (quarterly) and every 3–6 months during the second year. Prefer bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS; L-Dex) when available because contemporary clinical-practice guidelines support BIS for early detection of subclinical BCRL. Threshold to prompt early intervention: an increase in L-Dex from baseline of ≥6.5–10 units (vendor- and guideline-defined thresholds; many programs use ≥6.5) or an absolute L-Dex beyond vendor-validated cutoffs should prompt early short-course intervention. If BIS is unavailable, use perometry or standardized circumferential volume measurements with thresholds of ≥5–10% relative limb-volume increase from baseline to trigger evaluation and possible early intervention. Rationale: ALND, nodal positivity, radiotherapy, and elevated BMI place this patient at high risk. BIS-based surveillance detects subclinical changes earlier and supports earlier intervention which is associated with reduced progression to clinical lymphedema.

---

## Q2 (009_2)

If at 6 months postoperatively the patient’s BIS measurement rises by 8 L-Dex units from baseline but she has no subjective symptoms and no visible swelling on exam, what is the next best management step and the evidence supporting it in this clinical context?

### Answer 2

Next step: Treat as subclinical BCRL. Initiate a short course (typically 4–6 weeks) of a properly fitted compression sleeve (compression class 1–2), combined with education on skin care and a supervised, targeted exercise program; repeat BIS monitoring shortly after therapy to confirm stabilization/resolution. Evidence: BIS clinical-practice guidelines and prospective studies, including randomized/implementation data summarized in guidelines, show that early short-course compression for subclinical BIS-detected changes reduces progression to clinically overt lymphedema compared with delayed treatment.

---

## Q3 (009_3)

The patient asks whether she should use a prophylactic compression sleeve immediately after surgery to prevent lymphedema. Based on current evidence and her clinical parameters, what would you advise and why?

### Answer 3

Advice: Provide an individualized, shared-decision recommendation. Evidence is mixed: some randomized trials and prospective studies show benefit of prophylactic sleeves in reducing early postoperative swelling and lymphedema incidence in selected high-risk groups, while other studies are inconclusive. Given this patient’s high-risk profile (ALND + radiotherapy + BMI 29), two reasonable options are (1) implement BIS-based surveillance with prompt short-course compression if subclinical changes occur (preferred if BIS program available), or (2) offer a prophylactic compression sleeve during the immediate postoperative and radiotherapy period if the patient prefers a proactive approach after counseling about limited and mixed RCT evidence. Document the decision and plan for surveillance regardless of the choice.

---

## Q4 (009_4)

The operating surgeon asks whether LYMPHA (lymphatic microsurgical preventive healing approach) should have been considered at the time of the patient’s ALND; what is the current evidence-based recommendation you would provide regarding LYMPHA for prevention of BCRL in patients like this one?

### Answer 4

Recommendation: LYMPHA is a reasonable preventive option to consider at the time of ALND in centers with experienced microvascular teams, because observational series and small prospective cohorts report substantially reduced rates of BCRL. However, high-quality randomized data are limited, and long-term RCT-level confirmation is still evolving. Offer LYMPHA with informed consent and ideally within a prospective registry or trial. For patients who have already undergone ALND without LYMPHA, the preventive benefit cannot be applied retroactively.

## Q5 (009_5)

If the patient develops clinically apparent, nonpitting, fibrotic (stage II–III) lymphedema of the whole arm 3 years later with functional limitation and repeated cellulitis despite conservative care, what surgical options should be discussed, and which is most likely to produce near-complete limb-volume reduction in this phenotype?

### Answer 5

Options to discuss: (1) Liposuction (suction-assisted lipectomy) for debulking of adipose hypertrophy — most likely to produce near-complete and sustained limb-volume reduction in advanced fibrotic/adipose-dominant lymphedema, but requires lifelong compression thereafter; (2) Microsurgical procedures (lymphovenous anastomosis or vascularized lymph-node transfer) — may improve symptoms and reduce cellulitis risk, potentially restore drainage in less fibrotic disease, but are less likely to yield near-complete volume normalization in late, adipose-dominant stages; (3) Combined approaches, staged interventions. For this phenotype, liposuction yields the most reliable volumetric reduction in published case series and long-term follow-up.

---

## Q6 (009_6)

How should you counsel and manage perioperative and long-term exercise and weight recommendations for this patient to reduce her risk of BCRL, given her BMI of 29 and perimenopausal status?

### Answer 6

Counseling and management: Encourage supervised progressive resistance training and regular aerobic exercise, which are safe and have not been shown to increase BCRL risk and may reduce symptoms. Recommend structured weight-loss strategies to reduce BMI toward <25 if feasible and safe (nutrition counseling, supervised programs). Start exercise gradually with monitoring for arm symptoms and include skin-care education. Rationale: RCTs of progressive resistance training and aerobic programs in breast-cancer survivors did not show increased lymphedema risk and suggest symptom benefit; obesity is an independent risk factor for BCRL.

---

## Q7 (009_7)

If during radiotherapy the patient develops a surgical-wound infection requiring intravenous antibiotics and a short admission, how does this event alter her short- and long-term risk of BCRL and how would you modify surveillance and prevention strategies?

### Answer 7

Impact and modification: Wound infection is a recognized precipitant for lymphedema and increases both short- and long-term risk of progression to clinical BCRL. Management changes: intensify surveillance (e.g., monthly BIS or volumetric checks while recovering), lower the threshold for initiating compression and decongestive therapy, and reinforce skin care and infection-prevention measures. Rationale: Infection and postoperative complications are well-recognized risk factors cited in NEJM and guideline literature; closer follow-up allows earlier intervention to limit progression.

---

## Q8 (009_8)

Suppose the patient’s center lacks BIS but has access to perometry and circumferential tape measurement. Which objective measurement and diagnostic thresholds would you select to detect early BCRL and how would you reconcile measurement differences between modalities for serial surveillance?

### Answer 8

Recommendation: Use perometry if available for faster and reproducible volumetric surveillance; if only circumferential tape is available, standardize technique and landmarks. Use baseline measurement and a relative limb-volume increase threshold of ≥5–10% from baseline to trigger evaluation/intervention (many centers use ≥5% for early intervention and ≥10% for clinically apparent disease). When changing modalities, obtain a new baseline or perform paired measurements for calibration and avoid direct comparison without adjustment. Rationale: Consistency of modality and technique is critical; perometry and BIS have differing sensitivity/specificity, so thresholds and consistency drive surveillance interpretation.

---

## Q9 (009_9)

Identify three clinical-trial or novel therapeutic options (active trials or emerging technology) that would be reasonable to present to this patient for prevention or management of BCRL given her risk profile, and briefly justify eligibility or rationale for each.

### Answer 9

Three options: (1) LYMPHA (lymphatic microsurgical preventive healing approach) performed at ALND — reasonable preventive option for patients undergoing ALND and appropriate in centers with expertise; supported by observational cohorts and ongoing trials (e.g., NCT04328610). (2) Enrollment in BIS-based prospective surveillance/implementation trials that study early-intervention algorithms — applicable now given her high-risk profile and may offer structured early therapy. (3) Trials of regenerative adjuncts (e.g., Biobridge scaffold with vascularized lymph-node transfer or cell-based therapies) for patients with or at high risk for refractory disease — exploratory but appropriate to consider at tertiary centers or within trials. Rationale: high-risk features make the patient eligible for prevention/surveillance trials or referral to centers offering microsurgical prevention and regenerative approaches.

## Q10 (009_10)

Construct an evidence-based, individualized counseling script (two paragraphs) to explain this patient’s estimated absolute and relative risk of developing BCRL over the next 2 years, the uncertainties in preventive strategies, and a practical plan (surveillance, lifestyle, and early-action steps) that you would document in her survivorship care plan.

### Answer 10

Example counseling script:

Paragraph 1 (risk estimate and uncertainties): "Because you had an axillary lymph-node dissection (12 nodes removed) and will receive adjuvant radiotherapy, and because your BMI is 29, your individualized risk of developing breast cancer–related lymphedema (BCRL) is materially higher than for patients who had only sentinel-node biopsy and no radiotherapy. Published series estimate post-ALND risk in the range of roughly 14–40% overall, with many contemporary estimates clustering toward the lower end in centers using sentinel techniques and surveillance; however, sentinel-node positivity plus ALND plus radiotherapy increases your risk substantially during the first 24 months, when most cases typically present. There is uncertainty in precise absolute risk because estimates vary by surgical technique, number of positive nodes, radiotherapy fields, BMI, and surveillance intensity." (Citations: NEJM review; BIS guidelines; NCCN/ASBrS statements.)

Paragraph 2 (practical plan): "I recommend a structured surveillance program with baseline measurement now and BIS monitoring every 3 months for the first year (then every 3–6 months in year 2) if BIS is available, or perometry/circumferential volumetrics if not. If we detect a BIS change of ≥6.5–10 L-Dex units or a limb-volume increase of ≥5–10% from baseline, we will initiate a 4–6 week program of fitted compression-sleeve therapy plus skin care, targeted exercise, and remeasurement; this approach has been shown to reduce progression to clinically overt lymphedema compared with delayed care. I also recommend a supervised weight-reduction program and progressive resistance and aerobic exercise, and we can discuss the option of a prophylactic compression sleeve versus monitoring if you prefer a preventive garment despite mixed trial results. If you ever develop redness, pain, fever, or a wound infection in the arm, call promptly for urgent treatment because infection increases the risk of lymphedema progression." (Citations: NEJM; BIS guideline; prophylactic compression RCTs; NCCN.)
