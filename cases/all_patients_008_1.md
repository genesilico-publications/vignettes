# Case vignette

## Key demographics and relevant history
- Age/sex: 71-year-old woman.
- Prior oncologic history: 21 years earlier — clinical stage T1cpN1aM0, ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive lobular carcinoma of the left breast treated with lumpectomy, radiation, adjuvant chemotherapy, tamoxifen ×5 years, then letrozole ×2 years. Three years before current admission there was a locoregional recurrence in the left axilla; patient declined systemic chemotherapy and opted for surveillance.
- Autoimmune comorbidities: Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (RNA polymerase III antibody–positive) diagnosed 3 years earlier (limited to skin), Sjögren's syndrome.
- Other comorbidities: Gastroesophageal reflux disease, treated latent tuberculosis (remote), dyslipidemia, osteoporosis.
- Medications at presentation: Exemestane, goserelin, calcium, cholecalciferol, pantoprazole, rosuvastatin. Allergic to trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole.
- Social: Former light smoker (quit 50 years prior), rare alcohol, retired, lives with husband.

## Presenting problem and timeline
- 7 months prior to admission: progressive fatigue and exertional dyspnea.
- 2 months prior: worsening dyspnea with palpitations and dizziness; labs showed anemia, low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, peripheral smear schistocytes; Coombs (direct antiglobulin) test negative; complement levels reportedly low; low-titer cold agglutinins present. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis showed stable mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (unchanged from 2 years prior).
- Initial working diagnosis: Coombs’-negative autoimmune hemolytic anemia; glucocorticoids started.
- During first hospitalization (over ~7 weeks): progressive transfusion dependence (packed red cells every 2–3 days), empiric plasmapheresis for possible TTP (6 sessions), eculizumab started during second week, rituximab started during third week, IVIG given, cyclophosphamide started during sixth week. ADAMTS13 activity returned at 65% (reference >67%) — plasmapheresis stopped. Despite multiple interventions (plasmapheresis, rituximab, eculizumab, IVIG, cyclophosphamide), hemolysis persisted with progressive thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury (AKI) developing in week 7; patient transferred to tertiary hospital on hospital day 50.

## Examination and performance status
- Vitals on transfer: T 36.3°C, BP 162/98 mm Hg (rapidly controlled on single agent), pulse 105/min, RR 22/min, SpO2 99% on room air.
- BMI 17 (cachectic). Alert and oriented. Jaundice, scleral icterus. Mild skin thickening of hands and feet. No palpable adenopathy.
- Functional status: markedly limited due to anemia, weight loss 9 kg over 2 months, poor appetite and nausea — performance status poor (clinically consistent with ECOG ≥2–3 at that time).

## Laboratory, urine and peripheral smear findings
- Severe anemia on admission: hemoglobin 5.3 g/dL, hematocrit 14.8% (prior normal range reported ~12–16 g/dL historically).
- Reticulocytosis: reticulocyte count 15.8% (markedly elevated).
- Peripheral smear: 10–15 schistocytes per high-power field, anisopoikilocytosis, teardrop cells, nucleated RBCs, left-shifted myeloid series consistent with leukoerythroblastic picture and microangiopathic hemolysis.
- Platelets: 43 ×10^3/μL (new thrombocytopenia developed during hospital course).
- Hemolysis markers: haptoglobin ≤10 mg/dL; LDH markedly elevated (18,096 U/L); total bilirubin mildly elevated (0.4 mg/dL) but direct bilirubin listed high in table (interpretation: severe hemolysis predominates clinically).
- Coagulation/DIC parameters: PT prolonged (16.4 sec), D-dimer 9,321 ng/mL, fibrinogen 374 mg/dL.
- Renal function: serum creatinine 2.87 mg/dL, BUN 62 mg/dL. Urinalysis: 3+ blood, 2+ protein; urine protein:creatinine ratio 6.41 (nephrotic-range proteinuria); muddy-brown casts on microscopy consistent with acute tubular necrosis and pigment nephropathy may contribute.
- Complement: reported low complement levels earlier in evaluation (contextual but nondiagnostic).
- ADAMTS13 activity: 65% (reference >67%); value >20% argues against TTP.

## Imaging
- FDG PET–CT: diffusely increased, heterogeneous FDG uptake throughout axial and appendicular skeleton (spine, pelvis, proximal long bones), with no discrete lytic or sclerotic cortical lesions on CT—pattern most consistent with diffuse marrow replacement by metastatic carcinoma (or hematologic malignancy), rather than reactive hyperplasia.

## Bone marrow pathology
- Core biopsy: marrow 80–90% cellularity with ~80% replacement by sheets, nests and cords of nonhematopoietic malignant epithelial cells with enlarged irregular nuclei and prominent nucleoli.
- Immunohistochemistry: tumor cells diffusely cytokeratin (MNF116) positive, estrogen receptor (strong nuclear) positive, GATA3 positive, CD45 negative, E-cadherin negative — phenotype consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma (lobular histology favored by clinical history and E-cadherin loss).
- Flow cytometry: <1% CD34+ blasts; cytogenetics: normal female karyotype.

## Molecular/genomic testing and biomarkers
- No molecular/genomic sequencing results (PIK3CA, ESR1, BRCA, HER2 by FISH/IHC beyond prior HER2-negative status) are reported in the case text. PD-L1, MSI/TMB, or other targeted biomarkers were not reported.

## Prior treatment exposure and responses
- Prior local therapy 21 years earlier plus adjuvant therapies described above. Three years prior patient had locoregional recurrence and declined systemic therapy; she was on exemestane and goserelin at presentation.

## Hospital management and response
- Empiric therapy for TTP (plasmapheresis) given early, stopped after ADAMTS13 not diagnostic (activity 65%). Eculizumab (anti-C5) administered empirically for possible complement-mediated HUS — no clinical response. Rituximab and IVIG given without benefit. Multiple transfusions of packed red cells. Cyclophosphamide administered without reversal of hemolysis. Given confirmation of bone marrow metastasis and extensive marrow replacement, oncologic therapy (systemic chemotherapy with paclitaxel) was initiated; however, the patient had continued myelosuppression and declining condition, ultimately elected for hospice and died about 1 month after discharge.

## Final clinical synthesis
- Etiology: Cancer-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) secondary to metastatic ER-positive breast carcinoma with extensive bone marrow replacement resulting in microangiopathic hemolysis, consumptive coagulopathy, and profound transfusion dependence.
- Key features supporting diagnosis: leukoerythroblastic peripheral smear (schistocytes, nucleated RBCs, teardrop cells), diffuse heterogeneous FDG marrow uptake, bone marrow core biopsy with 80% marrow replacement by ER+/GATA3+ carcinoma, lack of response to plasmapheresis/eculizumab/rituximab, ADAMTS13 activity not diagnostic for TTP.

## Q1 (008_1)

Based on this patient’s peripheral smear (10–15 schistocytes per HPF), markedly elevated LDH (18,096 U/L), severe transfusion dependence, diffuse heterogeneous FDG uptake in the marrow on PET–CT, and bone-marrow core biopsy showing ~80% replacement by ER+/GATA3+ carcinoma, what is the most likely unifying diagnosis causing her hemolysis and thrombocytopenia, and what is the pathophysiologic mechanism linking the tumor to the hematologic findings?

### Answer 1

Most likely diagnosis is cancer-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)/microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) due to diffuse bone-marrow metastasis from ER-positive breast carcinoma. Mechanism: tumor infiltration and tumor-cell–mediated microvascular obstruction and endothelial injury with intravascular fibrin deposition, red-cell fragmentation (schistocytes), consumptive coagulopathy (elevated D-dimer, prolonged PT) and leukoerythroblastic features from myelophthisis. Explains transfusion dependence and lack of response to TTP therapies.

---

## Q2 (008_2)

Given this patient’s clinical presentation with life-threatening transfusion-dependent hemolysis and organ dysfunction (AKI and thrombocytopenia), should first-line systemic therapy be endocrine therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor or cytotoxic chemotherapy, and what guideline-based rationale supports your choice for this specific patient?

### Answer 2

Cytotoxic chemotherapy is preferred in this clinical context (so-called visceral crisis/organ-threatening dysfunction) because rapid tumor cytoreduction is required to reverse organ compromise and cancer-associated TMA. For HR+/HER2– MBC with organ/visceral dysfunction, guidelines and expert consensus recommend chemotherapy rather than endocrine therapy as initial systemic therapy. Paclitaxel is an appropriate cytotoxic option in this scenario.

---

## Q3 (008_3)

The patient received plasmapheresis, rituximab and eculizumab without clinical benefit and had an ADAMTS13 activity of 65%. Explain why acquired TTP and atypical HUS were considered unlikely and why these targeted therapies were not effective in this patient.

### Answer 3

Acquired TTP is characterized by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (activity <10–20%). An ADAMTS13 activity of 65% excludes TTP as the driver. Atypical HUS is frequently complement-mediated and often shows low C3 with normal C4; eculizumab is effective in complement-mediated TMA, but cancer-associated TMA is primarily tumor-cell–related endothelial injury and microvascular occlusion rather than complement dysregulation, explaining poor response to eculizumab. The biopsy-proved marrow metastasis and lack of response to TTP/aHUS therapies support cancer-associated TMA.

## Q4 (008_4)

If next-generation sequencing of tumor or ctDNA revealed a PIK3CA hotspot mutation in this patient, what targeted therapy would current ASCO guidelines recommend, at what line of therapy, and what clinical caveats would apply given her organ dysfunction?

### Answer 4

ASCO recommends alpelisib in combination with endocrine therapy (commonly fulvestrant) for postmenopausal patients with HR+/HER2– advanced breast cancer harboring a PIK3CA mutation after progression on prior endocrine therapy (especially after CDK4/6 inhibitor exposure). In a patient with life-threatening organ dysfunction/visceral crisis due to marrow replacement, immediate cytotoxic chemotherapy takes priority; alpelisib-based endocrine therapy is not appropriate as first-line in visceral crisis. Additional caveats: alpelisib toxicity (notably hyperglycemia, rash) and limited safety data in the setting of severe marrow failure, thrombocytopenia, and AKI, so use requires careful assessment.

---

## Q5 (008_5)

If ctDNA testing performed during first-line aromatase-inhibitor therapy had shown an emergent ESR1 ligand-binding–domain mutation, how would that affect endocrine treatment strategy, and what are the evidence-based options (including trial options) for patients with ESR1 mutations?

### Answer 5

ESR1 activating mutations confer resistance to aromatase inhibitors. Evidence-based options include switching to fulvestrant (a SERD) or enrollment in clinical trials of next-generation oral SERDs or PROTACs (e.g., imlunestrant, vepdegestrant). ASCO guidance supports ESR1 testing to guide switching endocrine agents. In the setting of visceral crisis, immediate chemotherapy remains the priority; ESR1-directed strategies are relevant after stabilization.

## Q6 (008_6)

From a pharmacokinetic and safety perspective, is paclitaxel appropriate in patients with renal impairment or those on hemodialysis, and what dosing modifications, if any, are recommended given this patient’s creatinine 2.87 mg/dL and severe cytopenias?

### Answer 6

Paclitaxel is primarily hepatically metabolized and excreted in bile; renal clearance is minimal. Case reports and pharmacokinetic studies indicate paclitaxel can be given without dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment or on hemodialysis. However, severe baseline cytopenias (platelets 43K, hemoglobin 5.3 g/dL) and marrow replacement increase the risk of profound myelosuppression; chemotherapy should be given only with clear palliative goals, aggressive transfusion support, and careful monitoring. Dose modification decisions should follow drug monograph guidance and consider performance status and marrow reserve.

---

## Q7 (008_7)

Would caplacizumab have been appropriate to use empirically in this patient while awaiting ADAMTS13 results, and why would it or would not be expected to help?

### Answer 7

Caplacizumab is indicated for acquired immune TTP as adjunctive therapy to plasmapheresis and immunosuppression; it targets VWF-mediated platelet aggregation and speeds platelet count recovery in severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. It is not indicated for cancer-associated TMA. Given the patient’s ADAMTS13 activity of 65% and biopsy-proven marrow metastasis, caplacizumab would be unlikely to help.

---

## Q8 (008_8)

List the tumor and germline molecular tests you would order now to guide subsequent therapy and trial eligibility for this patient (be specific), and justify each test relative to this patient’s disease biology and potential treatment options.

### Answer 8

Recommended tests: (1) Comprehensive tumor NGS (or plasma ctDNA) including PIK3CA, ESR1, ERBB2/HER2 alterations, and other actionable drivers (NTRK fusions, etc.); (2) germline BRCA1/2 testing; (3) re-testing of tumor ER/PR/HER2 (IHC and HER2 FISH) if tissue available to confirm receptor status and HER2-low/positive status for ADC/trial eligibility; (4) MSI/MMR and TMB assessment for immunotherapy/trial selection; (5) baseline metabolic labs (glucose) if PI3K inhibitors considered. Rationale: identifies alpelisib eligibility (PIK3CA), ESR1-directed approaches, PARP inhibitors (germline BRCA), HER2-targeted ADCs or HER2-directed therapy if amplification/newly positive, and trial enrollment opportunities.

## Q9 (008_9)

Provide an evidence-based estimate of short-term prognosis (weeks to months) for patients presenting with cancer-associated TMA due to marrow replacement by metastatic breast carcinoma, and indicate which clinical/laboratory features from this patient predict particularly poor outcomes.

### Answer 9

Cancer-associated TMA with extensive marrow replacement has a poor short-term prognosis; many series report high early mortality with median survival measured in weeks to a few months and approximately 50% early mortality in some cohorts. Poor prognostic features present here include extensive marrow replacement (~80%), transfusion dependence, very high LDH, consumptive coagulopathy (very high D-dimer, prolonged PT), new thrombocytopenia, and AKI — all predictors of poor outcome.

## Q10 (008_10)

Suppose the patient stabilized after one cycle of paclitaxel but subsequently developed progressive anemia and required persistent transfusions with platelet count persistently <50×10^3/µL and creatinine rise to 4.5 mg/dL; what are the evidence-based next steps for systemic therapy decisions, dose modifications, and supportive measures in an ER+/HER2– patient with these complications?

### Answer 10

If severe cytopenias and renal failure persist despite initial response, consider: (a) holding cytotoxic therapy to allow stabilization and reassess goals of care; (b) prioritize palliative and supportive care when morbidity outweighs benefit; (c) if additional disease-directed therapy is considered, select agents with minimal renal clearance and acceptable hematologic toxicity only if marrow reserve is adequate; (d) aggressive supportive care (transfusions, infection surveillance/prophylaxis, G-CSF for neutropenia where indicated, platelet transfusions for bleeding risk); (e) dose reductions/delays guided by product monographs. Clinical-trial enrollment is often limited by organ dysfunction. Multidisciplinary discussion and early palliative-care involvement are recommended.
