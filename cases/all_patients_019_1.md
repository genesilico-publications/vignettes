## Case

# Case vignette — Metastatic NSCLC with TPM3-NTRK3 fusion

Demographics and relevant history
- Age: 49 years
- Sex: Female
- Smoking history: Never-smoker
- Past medical history / comorbidities: None reported; no chronic prescriptions reported
- Family history: Negative for malignancy

Presentation and timeline
- Presentation: Progressive dyspnea on moderate exertion, intermittent blurred vision and headaches leading to evaluation and diagnosis of metastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
- Diagnostic workup: Archival tumor tissue underwent broad molecular profiling with RNA next-generation sequencing; result positive for a TPM3-NTRK3 fusion (RNA NGS). Specifics such as histologic subtype (adenocarcinoma vs squamous), stage details (T/N descriptors and number of metastatic sites), VAF, read depth, or copy-number changes were not reported in the source document.

Baseline organ function and performance status
- Pre-treatment liver function tests (LFTs): ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin were reported as within normal limits prior to initiation of therapy.
- Baseline renal function and formal performance status (ECOG/WHO) were not reported in the source document.

Radiology and CNS findings
- Baseline brain imaging: Not reported prior to therapy in the source material; subsequent MRI brain imaging during therapy is described below.
- During therapy: At 5 months after initiating larotrectinib, MRI brain showed a 40% reduction in target intracranial lesion size. FDG PET/CT showed reduced FDG avidity in lung and hilar lymph nodes.

Pathology and biomarker data
- Histology: NSCLC reported, histologic subtype not specified in the available pages.
- Molecular: RNA NGS positive for TPM3-NTRK3 fusion. The report did not include variant allele fraction (VAF), read depth, or additional co-mutations. MSI and TMB were not reported.
- Other biomarker testing: No immunohistochemistry (IHC), FISH, PD-L1, or copy-number data were reported on the provided pages.

Treatment course and toxicities
- Systemic therapy: Larotrectinib (VITRAKVI), orally, twice daily (standard adult dosing is 100 mg twice daily per product label) was initiated.
- Response: Sustained partial response after 6 cycles. At 5 months, FDG PET/CT and MRI showed objective improvement (reduced FDG uptake and 40% reduction in brain target lesion). At 11 months, disease was stable and larotrectinib was continued without dose reduction or interruption.
- Adverse events: Intermittent arthralgia and myalgia responsive to OTC NSAIDs. At 5 months there was mild transaminase elevation (ALT 70 U/L, AST 45 U/L) with normal total bilirubin (0.7 mg/dL). LFTs normalized by 11 months while continuing full-dose therapy.

Other events and management considerations
- CNS management: Treating clinician (Velcheti et al.) emphasizes initiating TRK inhibitor therapy promptly for patients with TRK fusion–positive NSCLC with CNS disease and deferring radiation when clinically appropriate because of observed CNS responses.
- Weight changes: Discussed as potential increased body weight related to increased appetite on TRK inhibitors; clinician suggested GLP-1 receptor agonists may be useful to manage clinically meaningful weight gain.

Source (primary pages parsed)
- Targeted Oncology summary of a case-based roundtable: "Targeting NTRK Fusions in Advanced NSCLC Leads Deep Responses" (April 25, 2024). Original excerpt provided via read_pages.

Notes about missing data
- The source pages do not report: histologic subtype (adenocarcinoma vs other), tumor stage descriptors, quantitative tumor burden measures (e.g., RECIST dimensions), PD-L1, TMB/MSI, VAF or read depth for the TPM3-NTRK3 fusion, baseline ECOG, renal function, or detailed prior systemic therapies (if any).

Clinical relevance summary (for oncology specialists)
- A middle-aged (<50-year-old) never-smoking woman with metastatic NSCLC harboring a TPM3-NTRK3 fusion achieved a deep and durable partial response to first-line larotrectinib with objective intracranial activity and only mild, transient hepatotoxicity. RNA-based NGS identified the fusion; RNA testing is preferred to maximize fusion detection sensitivity. Ongoing monitoring for hepatotoxicity, neurocognitive symptoms, and weight change is indicated. Resistance mechanisms to first-generation TRK inhibitors can include on-target kinase domain mutations (solvent-front, gatekeeper, xDFG) for which second-generation agents or clinical trials may be considered.

## Q1 (019_1)

For this 49-year-old never-smoking woman with metastatic NSCLC harboring a TPM3–NTRK3 fusion detected by RNA NGS, what is the guideline-concordant first-line systemic therapy choice, and what is the recommended adult dose and schedule?

### Answer 1

A TRK inhibitor is the guideline-concordant targeted first-line systemic therapy for an NTRK fusion–positive solid tumor when a clinically actionable NTRK fusion is identified; larotrectinib (VITRAKVI) is an FDA-approved, tumor-agnostic TRK inhibitor with a recommended adult dose of 100 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (dose modifications per label). NCCN lists larotrectinib among recommended systemic therapy options for NTRK fusion–positive tumors.

## Q2 (019_2)

The patient demonstrated a 40% reduction in a target intracranial lesion after 5 months of larotrectinib. In an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patient with such an intracranial radiographic response on TRK inhibition, what is the recommended approach to CNS-directed local therapy (radiation or surgery) and what evidence supports deferring radiotherapy?

### Answer 2

For patients with TRK fusion–positive NSCLC who have measurable intracranial disease that is responding to a TRK inhibitor (e.g., larotrectinib) and who are not highly symptomatic, the recommended approach is to continue systemic TRK inhibitor therapy and defer CNS radiation because TRK inhibitors demonstrate clinically meaningful CNS activity and intracranial responses; local CNS therapy (stereotactic radiosurgery or whole-brain radiotherapy) can be reserved for progression or symptomatic lesions. This approach is supported by clinical experience, intracranial response data from TRK inhibitor studies, and expert commentary.

## Q3 (019_3)

At 5 months the patient’s ALT was 70 U/L and AST 45 U/L with total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL while on larotrectinib. According to the product label and standard hepatotoxicity management for larotrectinib, what immediate management steps should be taken (continue, hold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue) and what thresholds require permanent discontinuation?

### Answer 3

Mild transaminase elevations (ALT/AST <3× ULN) with normal bilirubin are usually managed with continued treatment and increased monitoring per the prescribing information. Larotrectinib should be withheld for AST or ALT elevations meeting Grade ≥3 criteria (or per label thresholds) and permanently discontinued for severe drug-induced liver injury (e.g., AST or ALT ≥3× ULN with total bilirubin >2× ULN) or Grade 4 AST/ALT elevations that do not resolve with dose modifications. For this patient (ALT 70 U/L, AST 45 U/L, normal bilirubin), the appropriate action is close monitoring and continuation rather than immediate hold/discontinuation.

## Q4 (019_4)

If this patient eventually develops systemic progression on larotrectinib and genomic testing of progressing tumor or plasma reveals an on-target solvent-front NTRK kinase-domain mutation (for example NTRK3 G623R), what therapeutic strategies are supported by available evidence, and which next-generation agents should be considered based on mechanism of resistance?

### Answer 4

On-target solvent-front and gatekeeper kinase-domain mutations are known mechanisms of acquired resistance to first-generation TRK inhibitors. Second-generation TRK inhibitors (e.g., selitrectinib [LOXO-195] and repotrectinib) were designed to inhibit many such resistance mutations and have preclinical and clinical evidence supporting activity. Management should include confirming the specific resistance mutation via tumor or plasma NGS and considering a next-generation TRK inhibitor on a clinical trial or compassionate/expanded-access program when available.

## Q5 (019_5)

Given the molecular testing in this case was done on archival tissue using RNA NGS that detected a TPM3–NTRK3 fusion, explain why RNA-based NGS is preferred for fusion detection in NSCLC and how that affects clinical sensitivity compared with DNA-only approaches.

### Answer 5

RNA-based NGS assays detect expressed fusion transcripts and therefore have higher sensitivity for detecting gene fusions (including diverse fusion partners and breakpoints) than DNA-only panels, which can miss some fusions because of intronic complexity and coverage gaps. Clinical guidelines and expert consensus recommend broad, panel-based NGS—with RNA fusion detection or combined DNA/RNA approaches—to maximize detection of NTRK and other actionable fusions in NSCLC.

## Q6 (019_6)

For this patient with an actionable driver (NTRK fusion) and a durable response to targeted therapy, what is the recommended role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1–directed therapy) either as single agents or combined with chemotherapy, given typical biomarker considerations in driver-positive NSCLC?

### Answer 6

For NSCLC patients with an actionable oncogenic driver (such as NTRK fusions), targeted therapy is preferred as first-line therapy; immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy have lower efficacy in many driver-positive cancers, particularly when TMB is low and PD-L1 expression may be variable. Immunotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy is typically deferred until progression on targeted therapy, and decisions should consider PD-L1, TMB, and other clinical variables.

---

## Q7 (019_7)

If the patient requires a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor during larotrectinib therapy, what dose adjustment is recommended and what is the rationale?

### Answer 7

Larotrectinib is metabolized in part by CYP3A4; concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase larotrectinib exposure. The product label provides specific dose reduction recommendations when coadministration cannot be avoided (follow the label's recommended dose adjustments and monitor for increased toxicity).

---

## Q8 (019_8)

Which clinical trial design features or eligibility criteria would most likely permit this patient (with prior response to larotrectinib and current stable disease at 11 months) to enroll in a trial testing a second-generation TRK inhibitor for acquired resistance, and what baseline studies should be obtained to support eligibility?

### Answer 8

Resistance-directed cohorts in trials of second-generation TRK inhibitors typically require documented disease progression on a first-generation TRK inhibitor and molecular evidence of an on-target resistance mutation for mutation-specific cohorts. Eligibility commonly requires measurable disease per RECIST, adequate organ function, ECOG 0–2, and controlled CNS disease. Baseline studies should include body CT/PET, brain MRI, tumor tissue or plasma NGS to identify resistance mutations, and standard labs (CBC, CMP, LFTs).

---

## Q9 (019_9)

What reproductive counseling and contraception advice should be provided to a female patient of reproductive potential initiating larotrectinib, and what label warnings justify this advice?

### Answer 9

Larotrectinib can cause fetal harm based on mechanism and animal data. The label recommends that females of reproductive potential use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 week after the final dose, counsel regarding potential embryo-fetal risk, and avoid breastfeeding during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose.

## Q10 (019_10)

Based on published series and trials of larotrectinib in TRK fusion–positive tumors and the lung-specific experience, what are realistic expectations for objective response rate (ORR) and durability of response (median progression-free survival or long-term disease control) that should be communicated to the patient at treatment initiation?

### Answer 10

Across tumor-agnostic larotrectinib studies, reported ORR in pooled analyses was approximately 73% (with durable responses and some complete responses); in lung-specific series responses and intracranial activity have been observed but cohort sizes are limited. Many responses to larotrectinib are durable, with median PFS varying by series and some cohorts showing prolonged disease control. Counseling should emphasize high likelihood of response but variable duration and the possibility of acquired resistance; second-generation inhibitors or trials may be options at progression.
