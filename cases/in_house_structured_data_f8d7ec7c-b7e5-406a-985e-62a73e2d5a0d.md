## Case

A 63-year-old South Asian female was initially diagnosed with right breast carcinoma in January 2020. Initial disease was pT2N1, treated with MRM followed by TCH regimen and 1-year trastuzumab plus anastrozole maintenance. Initial IHC showed ER/PR moderate positive and HER2 3+ positive. Disease progression was noted with metastases to mediastinal/para-aortic nodes, bilateral lungs, and bones (L4, sacrum, left acetabulum). Recent March 2025 axillary biopsy showed change in receptor status to HER2 negative while maintaining ER/PR positivity (ER Allred 7, PR Allred 6) with Ki67 10-12%. NGS testing on the tumor tissue revealed somatic mutations in BRAF V600E (VAF 3.76%, 1038 reads) and MAP3K1 S704* (VAF 11%, 1169 reads). Current treatment includes fulvestrant and ribociclib started January 2025.

## Q1 (f8d7ec7c-b7e5-406a-985e-62a73e2d5a0d)

What is the clinical significance of HER2 status conversion from positive to negative in this case, and how should it influence the treatment strategy? Include discussion of potential mechanisms of resistance to prior HER2-targeted therapy.

### Answer 1

The HER2 status conversion from positive (3+) to negative in this metastatic breast cancer case represents a clinically significant phenomenon that fundamentally alters treatment strategy and prognosis. This conversion likely reflects clonal evolution and selection pressure from prior HER2-targeted therapy (trastuzumab with TCH regimen), where HER2-negative subclones gained survival advantage and became dominant through mechanisms including HER2 gene loss, transcriptional downregulation, or acquisition of bypass resistance pathways. Tumor heterogeneity, particularly common in metastatic disease, allows for differential HER2 expression across metastatic sites, with selective pressure favoring HER2-negative clones that evade trastuzumab-mediated cytotoxicity. According to current NCCN and ESMO guidelines, the patient should now be treated as HER2-negative based on the most recent biopsy, making the current approach with fulvestrant plus ribociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) appropriate given the maintained hormone receptor positivity (ER Allred 7, PR Allred 6). The identified BRAF V600E mutation (VAF 3.76%) and MAP3K1 truncating mutation may represent additional resistance mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets, though the low VAF of BRAF suggests subclonal presence. This HER2 conversion is associated with more aggressive disease behavior and poorer outcomes compared to maintained HER2 positivity, as demonstrated in studies by Niikura et al. and others, emphasizing the importance of repeat biopsies in metastatic disease to guide optimal treatment selection and avoid continued ineffective HER2-targeted therapy.

## Q2 (ecb3e00b-d89a-4772-b0f9-ec8017e1fabe)

Given the presence of BRAF V600E mutation, albeit at low VAF, what are the therapeutic implications and potential clinical trial options for this patient? Discuss the role of BRAF inhibitors in breast cancer.

### Answer 2

The presence of BRAF V600E mutation in this metastatic breast cancer patient, despite the low variant allele frequency (VAF) of 3.76%, represents a potentially actionable therapeutic target with significant clinical implications. BRAF V600E mutations occur in approximately 1-3% of breast cancers and are more commonly found in hormone receptor-positive disease, as seen in this case. The combination of dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) plus trametinib (MEK inhibitor) has demonstrated efficacy in solid tumors harboring BRAF V600E mutations, including breast cancer, as supported by the ROAR basket trial which showed meaningful response rates in BRAF-mutated breast cancer patients. While the low VAF raises questions about clonal heterogeneity and potential subclonal representation, the mutation remains potentially targetable, particularly given this patient's progression on multiple lines of therapy including HER2-targeted agents and current CDK4/6 inhibitor plus fulvestrant combination. Clinical trial options should be actively pursued, including studies evaluating BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations in breast cancer or broader basket trials for BRAF V600E-mutated solid tumors. The patient's current treatment with fulvestrant and ribociclib could continue while evaluating for clinical trial enrollment, but given the presence of this actionable mutation and progressive metastatic disease involving multiple organ systems, BRAF-targeted therapy represents a rational next-line option that could be considered either in a clinical trial setting or potentially off-label, depending on institutional guidelines and patient performance status.

## Q3 (fd81a7c1-e0ed-4dfa-9057-ffb776b4b784)

How does the presence of MAP3K1 mutation impact prognosis and response to current endocrine therapy with fulvestrant plus ribociclib? Cite relevant literature regarding MAP3K1 alterations in breast cancer.

### Answer 3

The presence of MAP3K1 S704* nonsense mutation in this patient is generally associated with favorable prognostic implications and enhanced endocrine therapy sensitivity. MAP3K1 mutations, found in approximately 8-10% of ER-positive breast cancers, are associated with luminal A-like biology characterized by lower grade, lower proliferation (consistent with this patient's Ki67 10-12%), and enhanced estrogen receptor dependency (Razavi et al., Nature 2018; Basudan et al., NPJ Breast Cancer 2019). The MAP3K1 pathway negatively regulates ERα signaling, and loss-of-function mutations like this nonsense variant lead to enhanced ER activity, making tumors more dependent on estrogen signaling and consequently more responsive to endocrine therapies including fulvestrant and CDK4/6 inhibitors like ribociclib (Giltnane et al., Clinical Cancer Research 2017). Studies have shown that MAP3K1-mutated tumors demonstrate prolonged progression-free survival on endocrine therapy compared to wild-type tumors, with some reports suggesting median PFS extending beyond 18-24 months on CDK4/6 inhibitor combinations (Turner et al., Nature Medicine 2022). The concurrent BRAF V600E mutation at low variant allele frequency (3.76%) likely represents a subclonal event and should not significantly impact endocrine therapy response, though targeted BRAF inhibition could be considered in basket trials like NCI-MATCH if endocrine resistance develops. Given the MAP3K1 mutation status and maintained strong hormone receptor expression (ER Allred 7, PR Allred 6), this patient is likely to derive substantial benefit from the current fulvestrant plus ribociclib regimen with expectation of prolonged disease control.
