# Case vignette: Case 35-2018 — A 68-Year-Old Woman with Back Pain and a Remote History of Breast Cancer

## Key demographics and baseline history
- Age/sex: 68-year-old woman
- Relevant past oncologic history: Bilateral breast cancer diagnosed 25 years earlier (left breast) with two distinct primaries in the left breast at that time: an ER-positive invasive ductal carcinoma (3 cm) and an ER-positive invasive lobular carcinoma (3 cm); 2 of 10 axillary nodes positive. Received 4 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (trial regimen at that time) followed by breast radiation; no adjuvant tamoxifen per protocol.
- Subsequent events: 12 years after initial diagnosis (13 years before current oncology evaluation) right-breast ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular neoplasia treated with partial mastectomy, radiation, and plan for 5 years of anastrozole (not completed). Recurrent pulmonary emboli at two time points; lupus anticoagulant positive; long-term anticoagulation with warfarin.
- Comorbidities: obesity (BMI 40.9), obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, osteoporosis. Remote penicillin allergy (rash). Active former smoker (1 pack/day ×25 years; quit 15 years prior).
- Family history: multiple relatives with breast cancer (mother, sister, maternal aunt). Prior BRCA testing was negative.

## Presentation and timeline of index illness
- Chief complaint: Back and pelvic pain of several months’ duration, midback pain worse sitting, 7/10 pain.
- Imaging timeline (incidental and cancer-related findings):
  - CT chest (obtained for suspected recurrent pulmonary embolism): resolution of emboli; incidental enlargement of left axillary (11–13 mm short axis) and left subpectoral lymph node (9–11 mm short axis).
  - Two months later, repeat chest CT demonstrated new mixed lytic and blastic lesions in thoracic vertebrae, ribs, and sternum, a mild compression deformity at T10 with extradural enhancing component, multiple enhancing splenic nodules (up to 12 mm), and a 12-mm hypodense lesion in the left hepatic lobe. Whole-body technetium bone scan showed multiple foci of increased uptake throughout axial and appendicular skeleton consistent with osseous metastases.

## Laboratory and performance-status data
- Laboratory values on oncology clinic evaluation (selected): hemoglobin 9.9 g/dL (anemia), hematocrit 30.3%, WBC 5030/mm3, platelets 167,000/mm3, INR 2.4 (on warfarin). Comprehensive metabolic panel values are not fully reproduced in the case excerpt; prior reports of liver and renal function were normal during earlier follow-up.
- Anticoagulation: chronic warfarin for recurrent pulmonary emboli (history of lupus anticoagulant positive).
- Performance status: ambulatory, reports significant pain but no focal neurologic deficit; estimated ECOG 1 given preserved activities of daily living and ambulatory status (explicit ECOG not reported in case).

## Imaging and pathology
- Bone-scan and cross-sectional imaging: Widespread osseous metastases (mixed lytic and blastic) including thoracic spine with T10 compression deformity and extradural enhancing soft-tissue component; multiple splenic metastases; small focal hypodense liver lesion (later proven to be metastatic on biopsy).
- Histopathology (sacral bone biopsy): Dyshesive tumor cells in single-file/single-cell pattern consistent with lobular carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry: strong nuclear ER positivity, PR positivity, cytokeratin positive, mammaglobin positive, E-cadherin negative. HER2: no overexpression (IHC negative). Diagnosis: metastatic invasive lobular breast carcinoma, hormone-receptor–positive, HER2–negative.

## Molecular/genomic findings
- Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) NGS (commercial CLIA 70-gene panel): two ESR1 ligand-binding–domain mutations detected in plasma (in trans):
  - ESR1 p.Y537C (c.1610A>G)
  - ESR1 p.D538G (c.1613A>G)
  - The NEJM case does not report variant allele fractions (VAFs) or read depths for these ctDNA calls; such quantitative details were not provided in the published report.
- Tissue NGS (liver metastasis; SNaPshot 91-gene assay):
  - CDH1 pathogenic frameshift: c.1947dupT, p.Ile650TyrfsTer13 — supports lobular histology.
  - PIK3CA in-frame deletion: c.328_330delGAA, p.Glu110del — reported as a variant of unknown clinical significance in the case.
  - AURKA splice-site variant: c.566+1G>A — variant of unknown significance.
  - Manual review of the liver biopsy sequences: ESR1 codons 537 and 538 were wild-type in the sampled liver biopsy (demonstrating inter-site heterogeneity compared with ctDNA findings).

## Biomarkers
- ER: strongly positive (tumor and metastatic biopsy)
- PR: positive
- HER2: not overexpressed (IHC negative; no HER2 amplification reported)
- E-cadherin: negative (supports lobular histology)

## Prior treatments, responses, and toxicities
- Index primary (25 years earlier): partial mastectomy ×2 (left), axillary dissection; adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate, fluorouracil) and radiation.
- Later right-breast DCIS: partial mastectomy, radiation, planned anastrozole (interrupted because of recurrent pulmonary emboli and weight loss).
- Metastatic setting (current course): First-line for metastatic disease per contemporary care: letrozole + palbociclib was initiated; palbociclib discontinued after 1 month because of nausea and dry heaves (clinically significant side effects); letrozole continued alone.
- On progression after ~1 year on letrozole, the patient enrolled in a clinical trial of an investigational oral SERD (trial NCT01823835 — early oral SERD/GDC-0810 family) and initially experienced disease control. Subsequent progression occurred with new hepatic metastasis; liver biopsy performed for molecular profiling.
- After progression on investigational SERD, capecitabine chemotherapy was started.

## Current status and therapeutic considerations
- Current anatomic extent of disease: Widespread bone metastases with symptomatic thoracic spine involvement (T10 extradural component), splenic and hepatic metastases (progressive disease after endocrine therapy and SERD trial).
- Molecular profile influencing therapy: ctDNA-detected ESR1 ligand-binding domain mutations (Y537C and D538G) suggesting acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors and partial resistance to some SERDs; however, ESR1 mutations were not detected in the liver biopsy tested, highlighting tumor heterogeneity. Tissue PIK3CA alteration is an in-frame deletion of uncertain significance (not a canonical hotspot in exon 9/20) — not clearly actionable per the case.
- Anticoagulation: active warfarin therapy with INR 2–2.5 range; complicates invasive procedures and some treatment choices.

## NEJM-case source and note on quantitative sequence data
- Primary source: NEJM Case Records (Case 35-2018), New England Journal of Medicine, 2018; volume 379 (case pages 1946–1953). The clinical report documents ctDNA ESR1 mutations but does not provide VAFs/read depth values for the ctDNA results; tissue sequencing similarly reports variant calls without read-depth metrics in the publication.

## Key teaching points
- Late recurrence (>20 years) is a recognized phenomenon in ER-positive breast cancer, particularly lobular histology.
- ESR1 ligand-binding domain mutations (eg, Y537C, D538G) commonly arise as acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors; these mutations can be detected in ctDNA and may be heterogeneous across metastatic sites.
- ER dependence often persists despite ESR1 mutations, and SERDs or newer oral SERDs can be effective; the clinical sensitivity may vary by specific ESR1 mutation.
- PIK3CA-targeted therapy (eg, alpelisib) requires an activating PIK3CA hotspot mutation (typically exon 9 or exon 20) rather than VUS in non-hotspot codons.
- Tumor heterogeneity underscores the complementary roles of tissue biopsy and ctDNA genotyping in advanced, previously treated disease.

## Q1 (003_1)

Based on the sacral biopsy, immunohistochemistry results, and the clinical course in this patient, what is the most accurate histologic classification and receptor profile of her metastatic disease, and how should this classification influence first-line systemic treatment choices in 2024 for a medically fit patient?

### Answer 1

Metastatic invasive lobular carcinoma, strongly ER-positive, PR-positive, HER2-negative, E-cadherin negative. For a fit postmenopausal patient with ER+/HER2– metastatic disease, preferred first-line systemic therapy in contemporary practice is endocrine therapy combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (eg, AI + palbociclib/abemaciclib/ribociclib), unless visceral crisis dictates immediate chemotherapy.

---

## Q2 (003_2)

Two ESR1 ligand-binding–domain mutations (Y537C and D538G) were detected in plasma ctDNA but were not present in the sampled liver metastasis; how should the presence of these ESR1 mutations influence endocrine therapy selection, and what limitations should be acknowledged when using ctDNA ESR1 results to guide therapy?

### Answer 2

ESR1 LBD mutations indicate acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors and favor switching from an AI to an ER-targeting degrader strategy (eg, fulvestrant or a potent oral SERD such as elacestrant). Limitations: ctDNA may detect subclonal variants (VAF/read depth needed to assess clonality) and may not reflect all metastatic sites; tissue heterogeneity can yield discordant results, so integrate ctDNA trends, tissue biopsy of progressing lesions, and clinical context.

---

## Q3 (003_3)

Given the patient's prior exposure and intolerance to palbociclib plus letrozole (palbociclib discontinued early for toxicity, then progression on letrozole), what are evidence-based systemic therapy options for second-line treatment after progression, and how would the ESR1 and tissue molecular findings modify this choice?

### Answer 3

Evidence-based second-line options: fulvestrant-based endocrine therapy (± targeted agents), alpelisib + fulvestrant if an activating PIK3CA hotspot is present, or single-agent chemotherapy for visceral progression (eg, capecitabine). In this patient, ctDNA ESR1 mutations support ER-degrader strategy (fulvestrant or oral SERD); the tissue PIK3CA in-frame deletion is a VUS (not an actionable exon 9/20 hotspot), so alpelisib is not indicated based on current evidence.

---

## Q4 (003_4)

The liver metastasis tissue harbors CDH1 frameshift c.1947dupT (p.Ile650TyrfsTer13) and a PIK3CA in-frame deletion (p.Glu110del). How do these findings affect therapeutic options and prognostic considerations specific to invasive lobular carcinoma?

### Answer 4

CDH1 frameshift confirms lobular histology but is not directly targetable with approved therapies; it informs biology (loss of E-cadherin, lobular patterns, late recurrence). The PIK3CA p.Glu110del is a non-canonical in-frame deletion (VUS) and should not be treated as an activating hotspot mutation; thus PI3Kα inhibitor therapy (alpelisib) is not indicated without a validated hotspot mutation. Prognostically, lobular histology is associated with late relapses and unique metastatic patterns that influence surveillance.

---

## Q5 (003_5)

How do specific ESR1 substitutions (Y537C vs D538G) differ in preclinical/clinical sensitivity to fulvestrant and newer oral SERDs, and how should this influence trial or drug selection for this patient?

### Answer 5

Preclinical and clinical correlative data show heterogeneity: codon-537 mutations (eg, Y537C/S) are often more strongly activating and may be less sensitive to fulvestrant at standard dosing compared with some D538G mutants. Differential suppression of mutant clones has been observed clinically. These data support preferential consideration of more potent ER degraders (approved oral SERD elacestrant for ESR1-mutant disease post-ET and CDK4/6i, or enrollment in trials for next-generation SERDs/PROTACs) when ESR1 mutations are present.

---

## Q6 (003_6)

The patient developed an extradural enhancing focus at T10 with mild compression deformity and significant back pain but no focal neurologic deficit. What is the recommended urgent management strategy for spinal metastasis with epidural extension in this clinical setting, and what factors would prompt neurosurgical decompression versus radiation alone?

### Answer 6

If there is neurologic compromise or mechanical instability, urgent neurosurgical decompression and stabilization followed by radiotherapy is indicated. If no neurologic deficit and the spine is stable, urgent radiotherapy (conventional palliative RT or SBRT depending on lesion characteristics) is appropriate. Decision factors include neurologic status, spinal instability (eg, SINS), degree/location of epidural compression, performance status, and life expectancy.

---

## Q7 (003_7)

How would the presence of low versus high variant-allele fractions (VAFs) for ESR1 mutations in plasma influence interpretation of clonality and choice of targeted therapy in this patient?

### Answer 7

High VAFs and rising trends indicate a clonally dominant resistance mechanism and support ESR1-directed therapy (eg, SERD). Low VAFs may indicate subclonal populations or technical noise; in such cases, tissue biopsy of progressing sites is warranted to guide therapy. Because the NEJM report lacks VAF/read-depths, clinicians should obtain quantitative ctDNA metrics and serial trends before making definitive mutation-directed changes.

---

## Q8 (003_8)

What are the important safety interactions and periprocedural anticoagulation considerations in this patient who is on chronic warfarin therapy, is being treated with capecitabine, and requires invasive procedures (eg, image-guided liver biopsy or spine intervention)?

### Answer 8

Capecitabine can potentiate warfarin effect and elevate INR → increased bleeding risk; concomitant administration requires close INR monitoring and dose adjustments. For invasive procedures, stop warfarin ~5 days prior and confirm INR normalization (check 24–48 h pre-procedure). Given recurrent pulmonary emboli and lupus anticoagulant (high thrombotic risk), consult hematology regarding bridging vs holding; consider switching to a DOAC when appropriate for cancer-associated thrombosis, but weigh contraindications (eg, lupus anticoagulant scenarios) and interactions.

---

## Q9 (003_9)

The patient was enrolled in an early oral SERD trial (NCT01823835) and initially had disease control but later progressed with new liver metastases. How should prior investigational SERD exposure affect consideration of currently approved oral SERDs (eg, elacestrant) or enrollment in additional SERD/ER-targeting trials?

### Answer 9

Prior investigational SERD exposure does not automatically preclude using a different, approved SERD (eg, elacestrant) if the patient meets labeled indications (ER+/HER2–, ESR1-mutant after prior ET). Cross-resistance is possible, especially for mechanistically similar agents, but elacestrant demonstrated benefit for ESR1-mutant tumors after prior ET and CDK4/6 inhibitor exposure. Enrollment in trials of next-generation SERDs/PROTAC degraders is appropriate, especially with progression on earlier SERDs.

---

## Q10 (003_10)

Provide three specific precision-oncology clinical trial or drug strategies (with rationale) that would be highest priority to consider for this patient at an academic center, given (a) ESR1 mutations in ctDNA (Y537C and D538G), (b) CDH1 pathogenic frameshift (lobular histology), (c) prior CDK4/6 exposure and SERD trial participation, and (d) visceral progression to the liver.

### Answer 10

Priority strategies include: 1) Enrollment in trials of next-generation oral SERDs or ER degraders/PROTACs targeting ESR1-mutant tumors (rationale: ESR1 LBD mutations drive AI resistance and may be overcome by more potent degraders). 2) Enrollment in trials targeting lobular-specific biology or CDH1-associated vulnerabilities (rationale: CDH1 loss defines lobular disease and may enable synthetic-lethality approaches). 3) If an actionable canonical PIK3CA hotspot is later documented, PI3Kα inhibitor (alpelisib) plus fulvestrant or trial alternatives would be prioritized (SOLAR-1 demonstrated benefit for PIK3CA-mutant disease). In the current case, the PIK3CA finding is a VUS and not actionable without confirmatory hotspot detection.
