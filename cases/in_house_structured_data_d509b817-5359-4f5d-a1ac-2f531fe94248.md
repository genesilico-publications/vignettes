## Case

A 45-year-old South Asian female presented with a left breast mass and axillary tail mass (18x15mm) in March 2025. Core biopsy revealed Invasive Breast Carcinoma NST, Grade II. IHC showed ER/PR strongly positive (78%), HER2 2+ (FISH negative), Ki-67 50% consistent with Luminal B-like subtype. Left axillary FNAC was positive for metastatic disease. NGS testing on the tumor tissue revealed somatic mutation in PIK3CA (c.1624G>A, p.E542K) with VAF 13.0% and read depth of 851 reads. The patient is currently in diagnostic/staging phase with pending definitive treatment plan.

## Q1 (d509b817-5359-4f5d-a1ac-2f531fe94248)

Given the Luminal B subtype breast cancer with axillary node involvement and PIK3CA mutation, what would be the optimal neoadjuvant vs upfront surgery approach? Include discussion on potential role of CDK4/6 inhibitors and alpelisib.

### Answer 1

Given this 45-year-old patient with an 18x15mm Grade II Luminal B-like invasive breast carcinoma and axillary nodal involvement, upfront surgery followed by adjuvant systemic therapy represents the optimal approach. The tumor size (T1c) does not mandate neoadjuvant therapy, and the presence of PIK3CA mutation does not influence the surgical timing decision, as molecular alterations primarily guide systemic therapy selection rather than surgical approach. The PIK3CA E542K mutation identified has limited therapeutic implications in the early-stage setting, as alpelisib is currently indicated only for advanced/metastatic HR-positive breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant after progression on prior endocrine therapy, not in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Similarly, CDK4/6 inhibitors have no established role in neoadjuvant therapy for Luminal B breast cancer. However, given the node-positive status and Luminal B subtype with high Ki-67 (50%), this patient would be an excellent candidate for adjuvant CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy with either abemaciclib (based on monarchE trial data) or ribociclib (based on NATALEE trial), both of which have demonstrated significant invasive disease-free survival benefit in high-risk, node-positive, hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. The treatment sequence should therefore be upfront surgery (breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection), followed by adjuvant chemotherapy given the Luminal B subtype and nodal involvement, then adjuvant endocrine therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor for 2 years, and concurrent radiation therapy as indicated.

## Q2 (d9bcf811-6610-4149-9918-cdb6803d340e)

What is the prognostic significance of Ki-67 of 50% in hormone receptor positive breast cancer? Discuss the evidence for chemotherapy benefit in this molecular subtype.

### Answer 2

The Ki-67 proliferation index of 50% in this hormone receptor-positive breast cancer carries significant prognostic implications and strongly supports chemotherapy benefit. Ki-67 ≥20% is associated with higher risk of recurrence, shorter disease-free survival, and overall survival in HR-positive breast cancer, with this patient's 50% value placing her in the high-risk category. The St. Gallen consensus defines Ki-67 ≥20% as a threshold for Luminal B-like classification, which correlates with greater chemotherapy responsiveness compared to Luminal A tumors. Pivotal trials including the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group meta-analyses demonstrate that high Ki-67 tumors derive substantial benefit from chemotherapy, with absolute risk reductions of 7-10% in 10-year breast cancer mortality. The MINDACT trial further validated that high proliferation markers identify patients who benefit from chemotherapy even when genomic assays suggest lower risk. In this 45-year-old patient with node-positive, Grade II, Luminal B-like breast cancer and exceptionally high Ki-67 of 50%, the evidence strongly supports incorporating chemotherapy into her treatment regimen, as the high proliferation rate indicates aggressive tumor biology with significant potential for micrometastatic disease that would respond to systemic cytotoxic therapy. The concurrent PIK3CA mutation does not alter this recommendation, as current evidence shows PIK3CA mutations do not significantly impact chemotherapy benefit in the adjuvant setting.

## Q3 (25d46ba8-907f-460c-9824-ecaf50bc05af)

How does the presence of PIK3CA E542K mutation (helical domain) impact treatment decisions and prognosis compared to other PIK3CA mutations? Address both early stage and potential future metastatic setting considerations.

### Answer 3

The PIK3CA E542K mutation in the helical domain has distinct implications for treatment decisions compared to kinase domain mutations, particularly relevant for this 45-year-old patient with luminal B-like, node-positive breast cancer. In the early-stage setting, while PIK3CA mutations generally confer relative resistance to chemotherapy and anti-HER2 agents, helical domain mutations like E542K may show different sensitivity patterns compared to kinase domain mutations (H1047R, H1047L), though current neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment decisions are not routinely altered based on specific PIK3CA mutation location. The high Ki-67 of 50% and node-positive disease in this patient would typically warrant consideration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with endocrine therapy, regardless of PIK3CA status. However, the most clinically significant impact of the E542K mutation will be in the future metastatic setting, where alpelisib (PI3K inhibitor) combined with fulvestrant has demonstrated efficacy in PIK3CA-mutated, hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer per the SOLAR-1 trial. Importantly, helical domain mutations like E542K may show differential response to PI3K inhibitors compared to kinase domain mutations, with some evidence suggesting potentially better responses to alpelisib, making this mutation clinically actionable for future treatment planning. The relatively low variant allele frequency of 13.0% suggests possible tumor heterogeneity, which should be considered when interpreting efficacy of targeted therapy. Current adjuvant treatment decisions should follow standard guidelines for luminal B-like, node-positive disease, while the PIK3CA E542K mutation provides important prognostic information and establishes eligibility for future PI3K inhibitor therapy in the metastatic setting.
