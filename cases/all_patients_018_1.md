## Case

# Case vignette: 72-year-old woman with metastatic colorectal cancer (NEJM case 018)

## Key demographics and history

- Age: 72 years
- Sex: Female
- Relevant past medical history: Hysterectomy at age 60; hypertension well controlled on lisinopril
- Screening history: Colonoscopy at age 70 was negative

## Presenting symptoms and timeline

- May 2018: Two-month history of bloating and abdominal cramping with an 8‑lb unintentional weight loss
- Initial workup: Hemoglobin 8.4 g/dL, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 6 ng/mL
- Colonoscopy: 9‑cm mass in the ascending colon
- Diagnosis: Invasive, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon; stage IV with multiple hepatic metastases on staging CT
- ECOG performance status: 1 at presentation

## Baseline pathologic and molecular data

- Histology: Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon (primary ascending/right colon)
- Molecular testing reported: KRAS wild‑type, NRAS wild‑type, BRAF wild‑type
- Microsatellite status: Microsatellite stable (MSS)
- HER2 testing: Not reported in the original case (documented expert recommendation to perform HER2 testing and expanded profiling later in the course)

> Note: Variant allele frequencies (VAF) and read depths for the reported RAS/BRAF negative status were not provided in the source document.

## Initial staging and imaging

- CT scan: Widespread liver lesions at diagnosis (multiple hepatic metastases)
- Subsequent imaging: New lung lesions identified on surveillance CT and later progression with additional lung and bony metastases

## Treatment course and responses (chronologic)

- First-line (May 2018): FOLFOX (5‑FU/oxaliplatin/leucovorin) + bevacizumab for 6 cycles — well tolerated; imaging at 2 and 4 months demonstrated response in hepatic lesions

- Maintenance: Bevacizumab maintenance documented after initial response

- June 2019 (progression): New lung lesions and growth of liver disease; switched to second-line FOLFIRI (5‑FU/irinotecan/leucovorin) + cetuximab — follow-up imaging showed stable disease in liver and lungs

- August 2020 (further progression): Reports of severe fatigue; CT shows progression in lungs and new bone metastases; patient started on regorafenib monotherapy (third‑line/ refractory setting)

- Subsequent plan (as discussed by the consulted expert): Consider HER2 testing and expanded molecular profiling; consideration for clinical trials and sequencing of available agents (regorafenib versus TAS‑102), with attention to toxicity profiles and prior adverse events

## Performance status and organ function during later course

- Documented ECOG PS 1 earlier in the course; expert commentary indicates preserved performance status at the time of consideration for regorafenib and potential trial enrollment
- Specific contemporary laboratory data (liver enzymes, bilirubin, creatinine, platelets, ANC) at time of regorafenib initiation were not reported in the source document and should be obtained when making management decisions

## Treatment toxicities reported in the case

- The case narrative indicates treatments were generally well tolerated until later clinical deterioration; no specific grade‑level toxicities (e.g., neuropathy, hand‑foot syndrome, severe marrow suppression) were detailed in the source document

## Expert commentary highlights (from Targeted Oncology transcript)

- Regorafenib and TAS‑102 (trifluridine/tipiracil) have similar efficacy in refractory mCRC; choice is individualized by toxicity profile (eg, marrow suppression with TAS‑102, HFSR/diarrhea with regorafenib)
- Retrospective and subgroup analyses support sequencing both drugs; some data (eg, REVERCE) suggest potential benefit of regorafenib earlier in sequence in specific contexts
- Emphasis on the value of expanded molecular profiling (including HER2 testing) and early integration of clinical trials given diminishing returns with successive standard lines of therapy

## Data gaps in the source document (items that would impact clinical decision making)

- No HER2 IHC/FISH results recorded
- No tumor mutational burden (TMB) or comprehensive NGS panel results (VAF/read depth not provided)
- Lack of contemporaneous organ‑function laboratory values when starting later lines (eg, baseline LFTs, bilirubin, renal function, CBC with differential)
- Limited toxicity detail for prior regimens (which would inform choice between regorafenib and TAS‑102)

## Implications for precision oncology

- Patient has right‑sided (ascending colon) tumor that is RAS/BRAF wild‑type and MSS. Right‑sided origin and MSS status reduce likelihood of response to anti‑EGFR therapy, yet cetuximab was used in second line with stable disease — this discordance is clinically notable and worth testing in questions that probe sidedness, anti‑EGFR benefit, and EGFR‑rechallenge strategies.
- Unassessed HER2 status may represent a targetable alteration; contemporary evidence (HERACLES, DESTINY‑CRC01 and other studies) supports HER2‑targeted options for HER2‑positive, RAS wild‑type mCRC.

## Q1 (018_1)

Given this patient's right-sided, RAS/ BRAF wild-type, MSS primary and prior exposure to cetuximab with stable disease, would a ctDNA-guided anti-EGFR rechallenge with panitumumab be reasonable at progression after regorafenib, and what patient-specific factors would most strongly support or contraindicate this approach?

### Answer 1

A ctDNA-guided anti-EGFR rechallenge is a reasonable, guideline‑concordant strategy for selected patients with prior benefit from anti‑EGFR therapy if liquid biopsy shows absence of RAS, BRAF, and EGFR-ECD resistance mutations at the time of rechallenge. Key supports: prior clinical benefit from anti‑EGFR therapy, preserved ECOG PS (patient ~1), MSS status, and adequate organ function. Contraindications: persistent RAS/BRAF/EGFR-ECD alterations on ctDNA, rapid clinical deterioration, or poor organ function. Trials such as CHRONOS and pooled analyses (CRICKET, CAVE, CHRONOS) demonstrate improved selection and outcomes when ctDNA is used to exclude resistance mutations prior to rechallenge. For this patient, prior stable disease on cetuximab and preserved PS favor consideration, but contemporaneous ctDNA demonstrating wild-type status is required before rechallenge.

## Q2 (018_2)

Should HER2 testing be performed now for this patient and, if HER2 overexpression/amplification is confirmed in a RAS wild-type tumor, what HER2-targeted regimens are the most evidence-based options and how do they apply to this patient’s prior therapy history?

### Answer 2

Yes. Expanded HER2 testing (IHC ± ISH/FISH or NGS copy-number assessment) is recommended in RAS wild‑type, chemorefractory mCRC because HER2 amplification is an actionable driver. Evidence-based options for RAS wild‑type, HER2-positive mCRC after progression on fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin/irinotecan include tucatinib + trastuzumab (FDA accelerated approval, Jan 2023) and other HER2-directed combinations with activity (eg, trastuzumab + lapatinib in HERACLES; trastuzumab deruxtecan activity in DESTINY‑CRC01). Given this patient’s prior anti‑EGFR exposure and multiple lines of therapy, tucatinib + trastuzumab (if eligible) or enrollment in a trial of trastuzumab deruxtecan would be reasonable.

## Q3 (018_3)

Between regorafenib and trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102), which agent would be favored for this patient now (she is on regorafenib), and what toxicity and prior-therapy factors should drive a switch or sequence to TAS-102?

### Answer 3

Efficacy of both agents is comparable in refractory mCRC; selection is individualized by toxicity profile and prior toxicities. TAS‑102 is associated with bone‑marrow suppression (avoid or use cautiously if poor hematologic reserve). Regorafenib causes hand‑foot skin reaction (HFSR), hypertension, and hepatotoxicity. For this patient currently on regorafenib, progression would justify switching to TAS‑102 if hematologic parameters permit. Prior severe marrow toxicity would favor regorafenib; severe HFSR/ intolerable hypertension or significant GI toxicity would favor TAS‑102. The RECOURSE and CORRECT trials define the efficacy benchmarks for these agents, and retrospective/sequence analyses (and REVERCE discussion) support individualized sequencing.

## Q4 (018_4)

If comprehensive NGS of the tumor reveals HER2 amplification with VAF 28% and copy number gain (CN=8) but ctDNA shows low shedding and no RAS mutations, how does the VAF and copy number influence the expected benefit from HER2-targeted therapy in this patient?

### Answer 4

A high-level HER2 amplification (CN=8) with a substantial tissue VAF (~28%) suggests a clonal/driver alteration and predicts a higher likelihood of response to HER2-targeted therapies. Trials (HERACLES, MOUNTAINEER, DESTINY‑CRC01) show greater activity in HER2‑amplified, RAS wild‑type disease. Low ctDNA shedding does not negate tissue findings; tissue clonality (VAF and copy number) is strongly supportive of HER2-directed therapy such as tucatinib + trastuzumab or antibody-drug conjugates in trial settings.

## Q5 (018_5)

Given the patient’s MSS status, what is the current evidence for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in MSS colorectal cancer and under what molecular circumstances (if any) could immunotherapy be considered for this patient?

### Answer 5

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective for MSI‑high/dMMR colorectal cancer but have minimal single‑agent activity in MSS mCRC. Exceptions where immunotherapy can be considered include presence of high tumor mutational burden (TMB), POLE mutations, or enrollment in combination trials designed to overcome immune resistance. Therefore, unless comprehensive profiling reveals MSI‑high, POLE hotspot mutation, or very high TMB, immunotherapy is not standard for this patient.

## Q6 (018_6)

Which liver-directed or palliative local therapy options should be considered given the initial heavy hepatic burden at diagnosis and later oligoprogressive lung and bone disease, and how should systemic therapy selection be coordinated with local interventions in this patient?

### Answer 6

Systemic therapy is the mainstay for multifocal hepatic metastases. Liver-directed options (SIRT/Y‑90, TACE, resection/ablation) are considered when disease is limited or downstaged. For oligoprogression (limited lung or bone lesions) with systemic disease otherwise controlled, local ablative therapy (SBRT, metastasectomy, ablation) can prolong systemic control. Coordination requires MDT review, attention to timing around systemic agents (eg, hold anti‑angiogenic agents perioperatively; consider TKI wound-healing risks), and assessment of PS and organ function. For this patient with widespread hepatic disease initially and subsequent multi-site progression, local approaches are limited unless disease becomes oligometastatic after systemic response.

## Q7 (018_7)

If the patient develops grade 3 hand‑foot skin reaction (HFSR) and hypertension on regorafenib with preserved hematologic counts, what dose modification strategy is recommended and how does the ReDOS strategy inform initial or rescue dosing for regorafenib?

### Answer 7

For grade 3 HFSR or significant toxicity, hold regorafenib until recovery to ≤ grade 1, then resume at a reduced dose (eg, from 160 mg to 120 mg or 80 mg daily per the intermittent schedule). The ReDOS approach (start at lower dose and escalate weekly as tolerated) has improved tolerability in practice and can inform re‑initiation at a lower dose with cautious escalation. Manage hypertension aggressively before reinitiation and monitor closely. If toxicity recurs, further dose reductions or discontinuation are appropriate per prescribing information.

## Q8 (018_8)

For trial matching: based on this patient's profile (age 72, ECOG PS 1, RAS/BRAF WT, MSS, prior exposures listed), which contemporary trial classes should be prioritized (mechanism and eligibility) and why?

### Answer 8

Prioritize trials of: (a) HER2‑targeted agents (if HER2‑positive) including tucatinib + trastuzumab and ADCs; (b) EGFR‑rechallenge strategies guided by ctDNA; (c) targeted therapy trials addressing actionable alterations found on NGS (MET, FGFR, etc.); and (d) novel combinations to sensitize MSS tumors to immunotherapy or targeted agents. Eligibility depends on RAS wild‑type status (favorable for anti‑HER2 and EGFR strategies), PS 0–1 (patient meets), and prior therapy lines (≥2 lines makes her eligible for many refractory trials).

---

## Q9 (018_9)

How should the clinician integrate tissue versus plasma NGS results when discordant (eg, tissue shows no RAS mutation and plasma ctDNA reveals a low-VAF KRAS mutation at 1.5% VAF)? What is the most defensible management decision for this patient specifically?

### Answer 9

Low‑VAF RAS mutations in plasma (eg, ~1–2%) can represent subclonal resistance or technical artifact. Clinical decisions should consider assay characteristics, prior anti‑EGFR exposure, timing relative to therapy, and tumor shedding. For anti‑EGFR decisions, many trials and guidelines treat any canonical RAS activating mutation detected in plasma as predictive of resistance; thus a reproducible plasma KRAS mutation at 1.5% would generally contraindicate anti‑EGFR rechallenge unless repeat testing or tissue rebiopsy refutes it. For this patient with prior cetuximab exposure, repeat plasma testing or tissue confirmation is advisable; absent reproducible wild‑type ctDNA, do not rechallenge with anti‑EGFR.

## Q10 (018_10)

If the patient develops declining hepatic function with bilirubin rising to 3.0 mg/dL while on regorafenib, how should systemic therapy and trial eligibility be adapted, and which agents require specific dose adjustments or are contraindicated?

### Answer 10

Significant hepatic dysfunction (eg, bilirubin ≥3 mg/dL) requires treatment reassessment. Hold regorafenib for grade ≥3 hepatic toxicity and resume at a reduced dose only after recovery per prescribing information. Tucatinib and other agents with hepatic metabolism require dose adjustments or exclusion until hepatic function recovers; many trials require bilirubin and LFTs to be within protocol limits (commonly ≤1.5–2×ULN). TAS‑102 is less hepatically cleared but severe hepatic impairment may still affect dosing decisions. For this patient, hold regorafenib, evaluate for progression vs drug toxicity, attempt to correct hepatic dysfunction; many investigational options may be temporarily infeasible until hepatic function improves; if recovery is unlikely, consider best supportive care or carefully selected agents with dosing guidance for hepatic impairment.
