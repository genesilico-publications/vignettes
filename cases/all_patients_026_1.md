## Case

# Case vignette — Aggressive castration-resistant prostate cancer with somatic FANCA homodeletion

Patient demographics and relevant history

- Age / sex: 59-year-old man.
- Relevant history: Newly diagnosed metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma, high-volume disease with bone metastases at presentation. No family history or germline pathogenic variants identified on matched white blood-cell sequencing (germline testing negative for pathogenic FANCA variants).
- Comorbidities: Not reported in the source; no chronic organ dysfunction or other comorbidities documented in the published case report.

Clinical presentation and timeline

- Presentation: Prostate cancer with local invasion (seminal vesicle involvement) and osteoblastic bone metastases (pubis, ischium, left femur at baseline on whole-body skeletal scintigraphy).
- Initial management: Androgen-deprivation therapy with a GnRH antagonist; docetaxel chemotherapy was added for high-volume disease.
- Response and progression:
  - After starting ADT + docetaxel, PSA fell to 3.37 ng/mL but rose after the sixth cycle of docetaxel.
  - Two months into therapy he developed gross hematuria; MRI showed progression with bladder invasion.
  - He received sequential second-line androgen-pathway agents (enzalutamide; abiraterone was also mentioned as part of the therapeutic landscape prior to taxanes in the article). On enzalutamide his PSA decreased from 7.08 to 3.16 ng/mL (55% reduction), but skeletal scintigraphy at five months showed new and intensified uptake in the ribs and scapula consistent with progressive bone metastases.
  - He was then started on cabazitaxel (given after docetaxel and progression on androgen-axis inhibitors). After three cycles of cabazitaxel his PSA stabilized at <10 ng/mL and no radiological progression was detected at that time; however, the authors indicated that acquisition of cabazitaxel resistance was considered likely inevitable.

Pathology and staging

- Histology: Prostate needle biopsy demonstrated high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma with fused glands (Gleason pattern 4) adjacent to solid sheets of poorly differentiated cells (Gleason pattern 5).
- Gleason score/grade group: Gleason 4 + 5 = 9; Grade group 5 (poor prognosis).
- Local extent: MRI showed tumor invading bilateral seminal vesicles (T3b) and later invasion into the bladder.
- Metastatic sites: Multiple osteoblastic bone metastases (baseline pubis, ischium, left femur; progression to ribs and scapula on follow-up bone scintigraphy).

Molecular and genomic findings

- Testing: Next-generation sequencing performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate needle-biopsy tissue (somatic tumor) with matched white blood cells to assess germline status.
- Key result: Somatic homozygous deletion (homodeletion) of FANCA (loss of the FANCA locus on chromosome 16).
  - Copy number analysis: FANCA locus shows a drop to copy number zero (Figure 2: copy-number variation plot).
  - Variant allele frequency (VAF) plot: FANCA signals cluster at zero VAF, consistent with homodeletion; many other somatic variants cluster at intermediate VAFs (0.3–0.6) reflecting allelic imbalance across the tumor genome.
  - Read depth: Not reported in the published figure/data for FANCA (read-depth details not provided in the case report); therefore exact read-depth metrics are unavailable in the source document.
- Germline testing: No pathogenic germline FANCA variant was identified (somatic acquisition of FANCA loss was reported).
- Other genomic features: Genome-wide allelic imbalance and subchromosomal deletions consistent with homologous-recombination–impaired (HR–deficient) phenotype and chromosomal instability.
- MSI/TMB: Microsatellite instability and tumor mutational burden were not reported in the case report.

Biomarker data (IHC/FISH/PD-L1)

- The case report does not provide immunohistochemistry (IHC) biomarker panels (e.g., PD-L1), FISH for ERG, or other receptor markers; none were reported.

Prior treatments, responses, and toxicities

- Androgen-deprivation therapy (GnRH antagonist): started at diagnosis (tolerated; PSA fell initially).
- Docetaxel: given for high-volume disease; initial PSA response (to 3.37 ng/mL) but PSA rose after cycle 6. Patient developed gross hematuria while on docetaxel.
- Enzalutamide: produced a 55% PSA decline (7.08 → 3.16 ng/mL) but bone disease progressed at 5 months on imaging.
- Cabazitaxel: started after progression on enzalutamide; after three cycles PSA stabilized and no radiographic progression was detected at that time. Long-term cabazitaxel resistance was anticipated by the treating team.

Current performance status and organ function (from source)

- The published case report does not provide explicit ECOG performance status or laboratory values (hepatic, renal, hematologic) at the time of genomic testing or at the time of cabazitaxel initiation. The patient was sufficiently fit to receive cabazitaxel and had no reported severe organ failure in the case description.

Interpretation and clinical implications

- FANCA homodeletion indicates loss of FANCA function and impairment of the FANCD2–BRCA2 pathway of homologous recombination repair (HRR). HRR deficiency confers sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents such as platinum compounds and to PARP inhibitors in selected settings.
- Clinical evidence and precedent: The case report cites preclinical and clinical data suggesting that FANCA loss can sensitize tumors to cisplatin and that PARP inhibitors (e.g., olaparib) have clinical activity in HRR-deficient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (see Mateo et al., NEJM 2015, and the PROfound trial and subsequent updates).
- Germline-negative, somatic FANCA homodeletion is actionable in mCRPC: tumor sequencing results can support consideration of PARP inhibitor therapy (depending on regulatory/label indications and prior treatments) or platinum-based chemotherapy in later lines; trial enrollment (PARPi trials, combination PARPi + ARSI trials) is reasonable.

Limitations of the source data

- Read depth, exact VAF numeric values per locus (beyond the plotted clusters), TMB and MSI status, and comprehensive somatic alteration lists (beyond the FANCA homodeletion and global allelic imbalance) were not included in the published case report. Performance status and lab values are not reported.

## Q1 (026_1)

Given this patient’s somatic homozygous deletion of FANCA (copy number = 0 on tumor NGS), prior progression on next-generation androgen-axis inhibitors and taxanes, and absence of a pathogenic germline FANCA variant, is treatment with a PARP inhibitor (for example, olaparib) supported by contemporary evidence and guidelines as the next systemic therapy, and what nuances apply to efficacy expectations for FANCA compared with BRCA1/2 alterations?

### Answer 1

Yes. Guidelines and randomized trial evidence support use of PARP inhibitors in mCRPC after progression on AR-axis therapy when a deleterious somatic or germline HRR alteration is present. Efficacy is gene-dependent: BRCA1/2 alterations show the most consistent and robust benefit; evidence for non-BRCA HRR genes (including FANCA) is biologically plausible and reported but less uniform. Biallelic (homozygous) FANCA loss increases biological plausibility of benefit compared with monoallelic events, but the magnitude of benefit is generally expected to be lower and less well characterized than for BRCA alterations.

---

## Q2 (026_2)

How does the tumor genomic evidence presented (FANCA locus copy number = 0, FANCA VAF cluster at zero, and genome-wide allelic imbalance) influence your confidence that FANCA loss is biallelic and functionally significant, and what are the limitations in the case report data relevant to making definitive conclusions about biallelic inactivation?

### Answer 2

The copy-number drop to zero and VAF cluster at zero strongly indicate biallelic (homozygous) FANCA deletion and functional loss, supported by genome-wide allelic imbalance consistent with HRD. Limitations: the report lacks numeric read depth and exact VAF values, orthogonal confirmation (e.g., FISH), and detailed tumor purity/subclonality metrics; these would strengthen certainty. Matched germline testing was negative, which supports a somatic homozygous event.

---

## Q3 (026_3)

For this patient, what is the evidence and rationale for using platinum-based chemotherapy (for example cisplatin or carboplatin) as a therapeutic option in light of the FANCA homodeletion, and in what clinical contexts would you preferentially choose platinum over PARP inhibition?

### Answer 3

Preclinical studies and case reports show FANCA loss can confer platinum hypersensitivity because platinum-induced crosslinks require HRR for repair. The case report and limited clinical literature support considering platinum in HRR-deficient tumors. Platinum may be preferred when rapid cytoreduction is needed (symptomatic/visceral disease), when PARP inhibitor is not available or contraindicated, or within trials; PARP inhibitors remain an evidence-based option, especially if regulatory/label indications permit. Patient comorbidity (renal/hearing), prior cytotoxic exposure, and trial availability influence selection.

---

## Q4 (026_4)

What additional molecular or laboratory data would you request to refine therapeutic selection for this patient (list specific assays and the rationale for each), and which of these data are not available in the published case report?

### Answer 4

Request orthogonal confirmation of FANCA deletion (FISH or validated copy-number assay), per-locus read depth and numeric VAFs, comprehensive HRD/genomic-scar assessment, plasma ctDNA NGS for heterogeneity and emergent alterations, MSI and TMB, and baseline CBC/renal/hepatic function and ECOG PS. The published report lacks numeric read depth, explicit VAFs, HRD score, MSI/TMB, and baseline labs/PS.

---

## Q5 (026_5)

If you elected to treat this patient with olaparib, what baseline safety evaluations and monitoring plan would you implement specifically for this 59-year-old man with prior cytotoxic exposure, and what dose modifications or contraindications are most important to consider?

### Answer 5

Baseline CBC with differential, renal and hepatic function tests, medication review for CYP3A interactions, and counseling on MDS/AML risk. Monitor CBC frequently (eg, every 2 weeks for month 1, then monthly), and evaluate for fatigue/GI toxicity. Dose reductions per label for hematologic or nonhematologic toxicity are required; severe baseline marrow suppression is a contraindication. Prior cytotoxic exposure increases MDS/AML risk and must be discussed.

---

## Q6 (026_6)

Based on published trial data (TOPARP, PROfound and subsequent analyses), what magnitude of clinical benefit (response rates or radiographic PFS) should be communicated to the patient with a FANCA-altered tumor as opposed to BRCA1/2-altered tumors when considering olaparib?

### Answer 6

TOPARP-A and PROfound show higher and more consistent response rates and rPFS benefit in BRCA1/2-altered tumors. For non-BRCA HRR genes including FANCA, responses are reported but less consistent; therefore counsel that benefit is possible given biallelic FANCA loss but the expected probability and magnitude are lower and less well defined than for BRCA2/BRCA1 alterations.

---

## Q7 (026_7)

Describe a guideline-anchored therapeutic sequencing plan for this patient immediately after the documented response/stabilization on cabazitaxel, incorporating the patient’s FANCA homodeletion, prior toxicities, and typical guideline recommendations.

### Answer 7

Reassess disease status, labs, and PS. Given prior AR-axis therapy and taxanes and a deleterious somatic HRR alteration (biallelic FANCA loss), offer PARP inhibitor (eg, olaparib) per guideline labeling for HRR-mutated mCRPC post-AR-axis therapy. Consider platinum chemotherapy if rapid disease control is required, if PARPi contraindicated, or within clinical trials. Encourage enrollment in trials of PARPi combinations or HRD-targeted therapies.

---

## Q8 (026_8)

Which resistance mechanisms to PARP inhibitors are most likely in HRR-deficient prostate cancers and what actionable next steps or testing would you plan if radiographic progression occurred on a PARP inhibitor in this patient?

### Answer 8

Likely resistance mechanisms: reversion mutations restoring HRR function, replication-fork protection, efflux changes, and restoration of HRR via alternative splicing. On progression, perform plasma ctDNA and/or tumor rebiopsy for NGS to detect reversion mutations; consider platinum chemotherapy if not previously used, and prioritize clinical trials (ATR/CHK1 inhibitors, combination strategies).

---

## Q9 (026_9)

Which clinical trials or therapeutic combinations would be high-priority matches for trial referral for this patient (state trial types and rationale), and what eligibility criteria specific to this patient’s molecular profile would you highlight when screening trials?

### Answer 9

High-priority trials: PARP inhibitor monotherapy or PARP + ARSI (eg, olaparib + abiraterone) trials, PARP + platinum or PARP + ATR/CHK1 trials, and novel DDR-targeted or immune-combination trials for HRD tumors. Eligibility often requires documented deleterious germline or somatic HRR alteration (some require biallelic loss or specify particular genes); prior AR-axis and taxane exposure and adequate organ function are usual criteria. This patient’s somatic homozygous FANCA deletion and prior therapy fit many PARPi and HRR-targeted trial eligibility frameworks.

---

## Q10 (026_10)

If this patient’s tumor sequencing had instead shown only a monoallelic FANCA deletion (single-copy loss) with retained FANCA expression, how would that alter therapeutic recommendations compared with the documented homozygous deletion, and what additional evidence would you seek to decide between PARP inhibitor therapy and alternative approaches?

### Answer 10

Monoallelic FANCA loss is weaker evidence for functional HRD and predicts lower likelihood of PARP/platinum benefit. Seek evidence of LOH, HRD genomic-scar score, orthogonal confirmation of loss (IHC/RNA or FISH), and ctDNA for clonality. If functional HRD evidence present, PARP inhibitor could be considered; absent such evidence, PARPi is less compelling and trial enrollment or alternative systemic therapy may be preferred.
