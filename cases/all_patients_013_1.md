# Case 30-2019: A 65-Year-Old Woman with Lung Cancer and Chest Pain

## Summary (chronologic, clinician-facing)

- Demographics and relevant history:
  - Age/sex: 65-year-old woman.
  - Past medical history: hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gout, anxiety, glaucoma, osteoporosis (prior kyphoplasty), prior ulnar fracture and radiocarpal dislocation repair, ovary-sparing total abdominal hysterectomy in early 40s. Family history notable for coronary artery disease (father) and lung cancer (mother).
  - Social history: 1.5 pack-per-day smoking up to time of lung-cancer diagnosis (30 pack-years), no alcohol or illicit drugs.

- Initial presentation and staging (timeline):
  - 6 months before current hospital admission: presented with acute lower-back, left paraspinal, and right flank pain. Imaging identified a spiculated 1.7-cm left upper-lobe (LUL) pulmonary nodule, left hilar lymphadenopathy, and lytic bone lesions (including T9 vertebral body ~2.3 cm). PET–CT showed FDG-avid LUL mass, mediastinal/hilar nodes, and osseous metastases (T8/T9 and right ninth rib).
  - Pathology: Biopsy of the lung mass demonstrated lung adenocarcinoma with a KRAS mutation reported (KRAS mutation type and allele fraction not provided in the record). Brain and spine MRI showed no cerebral metastases but confirmed lytic thoracic vertebral lesions and compression fracture.

- Initial treatments and early disease course:
  - Palliative external-beam radiotherapy to symptomatic vertebral lesions.
  - Systemic chemotherapy: four cycles of carboplatin plus pemetrexed over approximately 3 months.
  - Early restaging PET–CT after chemo showed progression with increased FDG-avid lymph nodes and osseous disease; further palliative external-beam radiation administered for symptomatic control.
  - Interim pulmonary course included progressive endobronchial obstruction of the LUL bronchus with complete lobar collapse and associated atelectasis; multiple short courses of radiation were used for palliation.
  - Immunotherapy: a single outpatient dose of nivolumab 3 mg/kg administered approximately 1 week after discharge (timeline: nivolumab given ~3–4 weeks before presentation with chest pain and elevated troponin).

- Presentation that led to admission (current event):
  - Symptoms: progressive back pain, worsening dyspnea, anorexia, sore throat, and new sharp, nonpleuritic left lateral chest-wall pain of several days’ duration that was positional and tender to palpation.
  - Vital signs: tachycardia (HR ~116), afebrile, BP 128/65 mm Hg, RR 20, SpO2 97% on room air. Cachectic appearance.
  - Physical exam: diminished breath sounds left side, crackles at the left apex, focal tenderness over the left lateral chest wall, faint radiation dermatitis on the left upper back.

- Key laboratory and physiologic data on presentation and during hospitalization:
  - Hemoglobin fell from 10.6 g/dL (1 day before presentation) to 8.9 g/dL on presentation.
  - WBC 11,710/mm3 on presentation; platelets 304,000/mm3.
  - Creatinine 0.60 mg/dL (normal); albumin low at 2.5 g/dL.
  - Troponin T: 0.19 ng/mL (1 day before presentation at other hospital) rising to 0.21 ng/mL on presentation and continued to rise to 1.08 ng/mL by hospital day 6 and 1.68 ng/mL by hospital day 8.
  - BNP (NT-proBNP) 477 pg/mL (not markedly elevated for decompensated HF in this context).
  - Coagulation: PT 16.6 sec, INR 1.4, PTT 37.9 sec, markedly elevated D-dimer (2006 ng/mL at one point), but chest CTs showed no pulmonary embolus.

- Cardiac imaging and electrophysiology findings:
  - ECG at presentation: sinus tachycardia (~112 bpm), nonspecific ST/T-wave flattening, no diagnostic ST-elevation; occasional PVCs.
  - Transthoracic echocardiogram: LVEF 57% with subtle regional hypokinesis (mid-inferior, basal inferior, basal inferoseptal); mild–moderate tricuspid regurgitation; normal RV size and function; no pericardial effusion.
  - Coronary angiography (performed after troponin rise and progressive ST depressions): minimal nonobstructive coronary artery disease.

- Pathology (endomyocardial biopsy):
  - Performed on hospital day 10.
  - Histology: dense interstitial lymphocytic and macrophage-predominant infiltrate with myocyte necrosis and myocyte injury consistent with lymphocytic myocarditis. Immunohistochemistry: CD3+ T cells abundant with a high proportion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells; CD68+ macrophages prominent. No giant cells or granulomatous inflammation.

- Clinical course in hospital and immediate management for myocarditis:
  - Troponin T rising to 1.08 ng/mL by day 6; progressive conduction disease culminating in complete atrioventricular (AV) block with idioventricular escape rhythm on day 8.
  - High-dose glucocorticoid therapy initiated: methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg started on hospital day 6.
  - Endomyocardial biopsy confirmed lymphocytic myocarditis, interpreted as most consistent with immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated myocarditis given recent nivolumab exposure and temporal relationship.

- Organ function and performance status relevant to oncology decisions:
  - Renal function: preserved (Cr 0.60 mg/dL).
  - Hepatic function: AST/ALT reportedly normal.
  - Cardiac function: LVEF preserved (~57%), but significant arrhythmia (complete AV block) and rising troponin indicate severe myocardial injury; patient required cardiology admission and close monitoring.
  - Performance status: cachectic, symptomatic with pain and anorexia; unable to exercise due to pain and cardiac symptoms (likely ECOG 2–3 at presentation).

- Molecular/genomic and biomarker data available and missing:
  - KRAS mutation reported on tumor biopsy (type—e.g., G12C—and specific allele fraction/read depth not provided in the report). No data provided on PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), other actionable drivers (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF), copy-number alterations, or next-generation sequencing (NGS) metrics (VAF/read depth) in the record. Peripheral blood (ctDNA) testing was not reported.

- Summary assessment and clinical implications:
  - The temporal relationship (symptom onset ~3 weeks after a single nivolumab dose), rising troponin, conduction disease (complete AV block), biopsy-proven lymphocytic myocarditis with CD8+ predominance, and absence of obstructive coronary disease together make immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated myocarditis the leading diagnosis.
  - Immediate management requires high-dose corticosteroids and multidisciplinary cardio-oncology care; severe cases frequently require escalation to additional immunosuppression and advanced cardiac support.
  - For systemic cancer therapy, the patient has prior platinum-based chemotherapy and an ICI exposure complicated by myocarditis; future systemic therapy decisions hinge on comprehensive tumor genotyping (to define specific KRAS allele), recovery from myocarditis, and risk–benefit considerations given the life-threatening irAE.

Notes and missing items that are clinically important and should be obtained if possible:
- Precise KRAS mutation subtype (e.g., G12C vs non-G12C) with VAF and read depth from NGS assay (tissue and/or plasma) to determine eligibility for KRAS G12C inhibitors (sotorasib, adagrasib) and to quantify clonal allele burden.
- PD-L1 tumor proportion score to inform potential ICI utility (though ICI rechallenge after myocarditis is generally contraindicated).
- Baseline ECG telemetry and repeated troponin measurements; consideration of cardiac MRI when feasible for noninvasive myocarditis characterization.
- Documentation of response to initial chemotherapy (objective RECIST measurements, if available) and radiation fields/doses for future planning.

## Q1 (013_1)

Given this patient's tumor was reported as KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma but the NGS report did not specify the KRAS allele, what specific molecular test(s) would you order now to guide targeted therapy options, and why? Include desired specimen type, assay characteristics (sensitivity to detect VAF), and the clinical implications of detecting KRAS G12C versus non-G12C variants.

### Answer 1

Order a comprehensive, tissue-based NGS panel (if sufficient tumor available) that reports specific KRAS codon 12 variants with VAF and read depth; reflex to plasma ctDNA NGS if tissue is insufficient or to assess spatial/temporal heterogeneity. Detection of KRAS G12C (eg, p.G12C) would make the patient eligible for KRAS G12C inhibitors (sotorasib or adagrasib) in the post-platinum, post-immunotherapy setting; non-G12C KRAS alterations are not targetable by these agents and would guide alternative chemotherapy or clinical-trial options. Assay characteristics: analytic sensitivity to detect VAFs down to ~1% in plasma assays (higher sensitivity in deep tissue NGS), and reporting of read depth allows assessment of confidence and clonality.

## Q2 (013_2)

Based on the clinical timeline (single dose of nivolumab ~3 weeks prior to presentation) and the cardiac biopsy showing CD8+ T-cell–predominant lymphocytic myocarditis, what is the most likely mechanism of myocardial injury, and how does this influence acute immunosuppressive management?

### Answer 2

Mechanism: PD-1 blockade leads to disinhibition of self-reactive T cells causing CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell–mediated myocarditis. Management implication: immediate high-dose systemic glucocorticoids (eg, IV methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day or pulse steroid for fulminant cases) as first-line therapy; severe or steroid-refractory cases warrant rapid escalation to additional immunosuppression (abatacept, antithymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab, plasmapheresis, or other agents) and permanent discontinuation of PD-1 inhibitors.

---

## Q3 (013_3)

The patient developed complete AV block on hospital day 8. What is the recommended immediate cardiac management for high-grade AV block in ICI-associated myocarditis, and what are the long-term device considerations once myocarditis has been treated?

### Answer 3

Immediate management: support with temporary pacing (transvenous or external) for hemodynamic compromise; continuous telemetry and ICU-level monitoring. If block persists despite immunosuppression and recovery is not rapid, consider permanent pacemaker implantation. Long-term decisions should weigh reversibility, cancer prognosis, expected survival, and risk of recurrent conduction disease; many reported cases of ICI-associated AV block have ultimately required permanent pacing.

---

## Q4 (013_4)

Should nivolumab be resumed in this patient after clinical recovery from myocarditis, and if not, under what exceptional circumstances could rechallenge be considered? Reference guideline recommendations and risk stratification.

### Answer 4

PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors should be permanently discontinued after severe (grade 3–4) ICI-associated myocarditis. Rechallenge is generally contraindicated due to high risk of recurrent and potentially fatal myocarditis; only in exceptional, carefully consented circumstances with multidisciplinary input and close cardiac monitoring might rechallenge be considered, typically for lower-grade toxicities rather than myocarditis.

---

## Q5 (013_5)

Considering the patient has preserved LVEF (57%) but elevated troponin and conduction abnormalities, what prognostic factors predict major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in ICI-associated myocarditis, and how would these influence monitoring and therapy escalation?

### Answer 5

High-risk prognostic features include high peak troponin, early onset after ICI exposure, presence of arrhythmia or high-degree AV block, concurrent myositis/myasthenia features, and rapidly progressive clinical course. Presence of these features necessitates aggressive immunosuppression, ICU-level monitoring, and low threshold for mechanical or pacing support and escalation to additional immunomodulatory agents.

## Q6 (013_6)

If the tumor harbors a KRAS G12C mutation with VAF 8% and read depth 2000, what is the expected response rate to sotorasib or adagrasib in previously treated NSCLC, and how does VAF influence interpretation and expected benefit?

### Answer 6

Clinical trials of sotorasib (CodeBreaK 100) and adagrasib (KRYSTAL-1) in previously treated KRAS G12C NSCLC reported objective response rates of approximately 32–43% with median durations of response in the range of ~6–8 months. A tissue or plasma VAF of 8% at high read depth confirms presence of the mutant clone; responses have been observed across a range of VAFs, but lower VAF may indicate subclonality or lower tumor fraction and could correlate with lower likelihood or shorter duration of benefit compared with high-clonality mutations.

## Q7 (013_7)

Design a post-myocarditis cancer-treatment plan prioritizing safety and cancer control for this patient, including immediate next systemic therapy options, sequencing, and monitoring, given prior carboplatin/pemetrexed and a life-threatening irAE from nivolumab.

### Answer 7

Prioritize cardiac recovery and steroid tapering before initiating further systemic therapy. Permanently discontinue PD-1 inhibitors. If KRAS G12C is confirmed, consider sotorasib or adagrasib after stabilization (both are approved for patients with prior systemic therapy). If non-G12C or not eligible, consider single-agent docetaxel or docetaxel plus ramucirumab (as tolerated) or clinical trials. Monitor closely with serial troponin, ECGs, echocardiography, and multidisciplinary cardio-oncology follow-up.

## Q8 (013_8)

What immunosuppressive escalation strategies are supported by evidence for steroid-refractory ICI-associated myocarditis, and what are the key monitoring parameters and infectious-prophylaxis considerations when using agents such as abatacept or alemtuzumab?

### Answer 8

Escalation options supported by case reports/series include abatacept (CTLA-4–Ig), antithymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab, and other targeted immune modulators; randomized data are limited although trials (eg, ATRIUM abatacept trial) are ongoing. Key monitoring includes CBC, LFTs, viral reactivation (eg, CMV), serial troponin, ECG, echo, and infection surveillance. Use appropriate prophylaxis for PJP and consider antiviral prophylaxis for agents causing profound lymphopenia; coordinate with infectious diseases for prolonged immunosuppression.

---

## Q9 (013_9)

Create three trial-matching suggestions (phase I–III) that would be appropriate for this patient after recovery from myocarditis, specifying eligibility criteria that would be met or not met in this patient (e.g., prior lines of therapy, organ-function requirements, history of myocarditis).

### Answer 9

Appropriate trial types: (1) KRAS G12C inhibitor trials (eg, adagrasib combinations) — eligibility: must have KRAS G12C and prior therapy; active myocarditis would exclude until resolved; prior ICI exposure acceptable. (2) Trials of SHP2 or SOS1 inhibitors combined with targeted agents for KRAS-mutant tumors — eligibility: documented KRAS mutation and organ-function criteria; active myocarditis typically excludes enrolment until recovery. (3) Trials of novel cytotoxic or ADC agents without immune activation — eligibility: prior lines may be acceptable; some early-phase trials exclude patients with recent severe immune-related AEs. Always confirm each protocol's exclusion criteria for active autoimmune disease or recent severe irAEs.

## Q10 (013_10)

Based on this patient’s clinical data, what surveillance plan (including frequency of troponin, ECG, echocardiography, and oncology restaging) would you implement in the first 12 months after hospital discharge to monitor for cardiac recovery and cancer progression?

### Answer 10

Acute-phase surveillance: daily or every-other-day troponin until downtrending in hospital, continuous telemetry while inpatient. Early postdischarge: weekly troponin for 4 weeks, then every 4–6 weeks for 3 months, with ECG at each visit; echocardiography at 1 month and 3 months postdischarge, and additional imaging as clinically indicated. Oncology restaging: cross-sectional imaging (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis or PET-CT) at ~6–8 weeks after stabilization to assess disease status and to guide timing of systemic therapy. Close cardio-oncology follow-up at 1–2 weeks after discharge.
