## Case

# Case vignette: Relapsed high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma with somatic RAD51C mutation

## Patient demographics and relevant history
- Age/sex: 74-year-old woman.
- Relevant past medical history: Prior breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy in 2009; autoimmune hypothyroidism.
- Family history: Not reported in the source document.
- Germline testing performed: Germline BRCA1/2 testing was negative. Germline RAD51C testing was not performed (limited availability).

## Initial presentation and staging
- Presentation: October 2016 with abdominal pain and distension; large adnexal mass and gross ascites.
- Tumor marker at presentation: CA125 1762 U/mL (markedly elevated).
- Imaging: PET-CT demonstrated extensive hypermetabolic peritoneal disease with involvement of bilateral adnexa, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen—consistent with stage IV high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.
- Cytology/pathology: Paracentesis cytology positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. IHC on cytology favored Müllerian origin (CK7+, PAX8+, CK20-). Interval debulking specimen showed high-grade serous carcinoma involving both ovaries, omentum, and peritoneum with residual miliary disease on the mesentery after surgery.

## Initial treatment course
- Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Oct 2016–Jan 2017): Carboplatin + paclitaxel x4 cycles. CA125 decreased from 1762 to ~60 U/mL; PET-CT showed good partial response.
- Surgery (Jan 2017): Interval debulking (TAH-BSO and omentectomy) with residual miliary disease.
- Adjuvant chemotherapy (post-op Jan–Jul 2017): 6 cycles of cisplatin + paclitaxel (carboplatin substituted with cisplatin due to thrombocytopenia). Post-chemotherapy PET-CT showed complete response and CA125 normalized to 11.1 U/mL.

## Relapse history, subsequent therapies, and toxicities
- First relapse (Feb 2018; 7 months after completion): Peritoneal, hepatic and nodal recurrence by PET-CT.
  - Therapy: 6 cycles cisplatin + gemcitabine + bevacizumab.
  - Hematologic toxicity: Recurrent grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 anemia requiring platelet and RBC transfusions.
  - Outcome: PET-CT complete response (Sep 2018); then maintenance bevacizumab x11 cycles to May 2019.

- Second relapse (Jun 2019; ~9 months after last chemotherapy): Nodal disease in abdomen and left supraclavicular fossa.
  - Treatment choice considerations: Advanced age and poor marrow reserve — clinicians selected non-platinum single agents.
  - Subsequent lines: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin x4 cycles (progression), topotecan x6 cycles (progression), docetaxel x5 cycles (progression) through Sep 2020.
  - Disease status Oct 2020: PET-CT with hypermetabolic abdominal, thoracic and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and liver metastases.

## Tumor genomic testing and precision-directed therapy
- Somatic tumor testing: FoundationOne CDx™ performed after progressive disease on multiple lines; result: somatic RAD51C mutations reported. The original report in the source did not provide variant allele fraction (VAF), read depth, copy-number details, MSI or TMB data in the published case report.
- Germline testing: Germline RAD51C testing was not performed and therefore germline vs somatic status of the RAD51C variant(s) was not established.

## PARP inhibitor treatment, response, and toxicities
- Drug and dosing: Olaparib 300 mg twice daily started October 2020 (standard tablet dosing schedule documented in the case).
- Baseline CA125 prior to olaparib: 685 U/mL.
- Hematologic toxicity on olaparib: Grade 3 anemia (hemoglobin 7.9 g/dL) requiring dose reduction to 200 mg twice daily in February 2021.
- Response: CA125 declined and normalized to 9 U/mL; PET-CT in November 2021 showed complete response. At time of last follow-up (December 2021), patient was clinically well and continued olaparib. Duration on olaparib at time of report: 13 months to documented complete response and 14 months on therapy overall.

## Current performance status and organ function
- Performance status: Not explicitly recorded in the report; described as "well" at last visit (Dec 2021). ECOG PS was not specified.
- Hematologic reserve: History of severe thrombocytopenia and anemia during prior platinum-based therapy; poor marrow reserve influenced treatment choices (non-platinum agents were selected for later lines). On olaparib, patient experienced grade 3 anemia requiring dose reduction.
- Renal/hepatic function: Specific creatinine, hepatic panel, and other organ-function values were not reported in the published case.

## Pathology and biomarkers
- Histology: High-grade serous carcinoma of ovarian origin.
- IHC: CK7+, PAX8+ supports Müllerian origin; CK20-.
- Biomarkers: No PD-L1, FISH, or other IHC biomarker results were reported. MSI and TMB values were not reported in the case report.

## Key clinical takeaways
- Somatic RAD51C mutation identified in a heavily pretreated, elderly patient with relapsed high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.
- Olaparib monotherapy produced a clinically meaningful and durable complete metabolic and biochemical response despite prior platinum resistance and poor marrow reserve; hematologic toxicity (anemia) required dose reduction.
- Germline RAD51C status was not assessed and should be considered for both therapeutic implications and familial risk counseling.
- Variant-level details (VAF, read depth, specific nucleotide/protein change) were not reported in the publication; lack of these details limits precise interpretation of clonality and allelic status (loss of heterozygosity) that can affect PARPi sensitivity predictions.

## Q1 (023_1)

Considering this patient’s tumor harbors a somatic RAD51C mutation and she has had multiple prior chemotherapy lines with poor marrow reserve, is initiation of olaparib monotherapy in October 2020 consistent with available evidence and guideline-supported practice? Please explain the level of evidence, whether this is on- or off-label, and the rationale referencing RAD51C-specific data.

### Answer 1

- Evidence and rationale: PARP inhibitors demonstrate activity in tumors with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene alterations beyond BRCA1/2. Phase 2 ARIEL2 (rucaparib) identified objective responses in RAD51C- and RAD51D-mutant tumors, supporting PARPi sensitivity in these non-BRCA HRR-deficient cancers. Regulatory approvals for olaparib are primarily for BRCA-mutated and certain maintenance settings; single-agent olaparib in non-BRCA, somatic RAD51C-mutant tumors is supported by biologic rationale and published efficacy signals but may be off-label depending on jurisdiction and label specifics. Given the patient’s heavy pre-treatment and poor marrow reserve, use of oral PARPi (olaparib) is clinically reasonable and supported by peer-reviewed evidence and practice guidelines that endorse genomic profiling and consideration of PARPi for HRR-mutated tumors.

---

## Q2 (023_2)

Should germline testing for RAD51C (and broader hereditary ovarian cancer panel) be performed now for this patient, and how would a germline RAD51C pathogenic variant change management for the patient and family counseling?

### Answer 2

- Yes. Rationale: RAD51C is a known moderate-penetrance hereditary ovarian cancer gene (germline prevalence ~0.35%–0.68% in EOC cohorts). Identification of a germline RAD51C pathogenic variant has implications for cascade testing of relatives, potential increased surveillance and prevention counseling (risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy offered when appropriate), and may support interpretation of tumor HR status. For the patient’s treatment, a confirmed germline mutation would further support PARPi use but would not substantially change immediate systemic therapy beyond confirming inherited risk; it would change genetic counseling, cascade testing, and familial risk management.

---

## Q3 (023_3)

Given the patient’s prior treatment timeline (neoadjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel → interval debulking → adjuvant cisplatin/paclitaxel; first relapse 7 months after chemotherapy completion; subsequent platinum-containing salvage with response, then later non-platinum lines with progression), how would you classify her platinum-sensitivity at the time of olaparib initiation (Oct 2020), and how does that classification influence expected PARPi activity?

### Answer 3

- Classification: Early recurrences show she was initially platinum-sensitive (first relapse at 7 months after platinum). However, by Oct 2020 she had progressed after multiple non-platinum therapies and had received several lines since her last platinum exposure (last platinum-based therapy completed in 2018). The contemporary designation at olaparib start is best described as heavily pretreated with prior platinum sensitivity earlier in the course but not recently platinum-rechallenged; empiric PARPi activity in RAD51C-mutant tumors is observed across platinum-sensitive and some platinum-resistant settings, but prior platinum sensitivity tends to correlate with higher PARPi response rates. Therefore, while prior platinum sensitivity supports PARPi efficacy, the heavily pretreated state and intervals without recent platinum exposure may temper expectations.

## Q4 (023_4)

The patient developed grade 3 anemia on olaparib and the dose was reduced from 300 mg BID to 200 mg BID. Was this dose modification consistent with manufacturer guidance, and what are evidence-based management steps for significant anemia on olaparib in an elderly patient with poor marrow reserve?

### Answer 4

- Yes. Manufacturer (Lynparza) prescribing information recommends dose interruption and reduction for grade ≥3 anemia until recovery, with specific dose-reduction steps (300 mg → 250 mg → 200 mg BID or equivalent tablet/capsule guidance depending on formulation and current label). Management includes temporary treatment interruption, evaluation for other causes of anemia, transfusion support when indicated, and cautious use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents per local standards, with close CBC monitoring given this patient’s poor marrow reserve and prior transfusion requirement.

---

## Q5 (023_5)

The published case report did not provide variant allele fraction (VAF), read depth, loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) or HRD score for the RAD51C mutation. What additional molecular/genomic data would you request from the tumor assay (or recommend re-testing) to inform prognosis and PARPi sensitivity for this patient, and why?

### Answer 5

- Request/report: (1) specific RAD51C nucleotide/protein alteration(s), (2) variant allele fraction (VAF) and read depth to help infer clonality, (3) LOH status at RAD51C or genome-wide LOH/HRD score, (4) copy-number alterations (including BRCA1/2 deletions), (5) MSI and TMB, and (6) whether the mutation is labelled pathogenic/likely pathogenic vs VUS. Rationale: VAF and LOH inform biallelic inactivation likelihood (which predicts PARPi sensitivity); HRD scores or LOH extent have been correlated with PARPi responses in ARIEL2 and other studies; precisely annotated variant pathogenicity is necessary to interpret functional impact.

## Q6 (023_6)

If the patient subsequently progresses on olaparib, what molecular resistance mechanisms are most likely in RAD51C-mutant ovarian carcinoma, and what diagnostic test(s) would you prioritize to detect these mechanisms?

### Answer 6

- Likely resistance mechanisms: secondary (reversion) mutations restoring RAD51C/RAD51D/BRCA function, restoration of homologous recombination via secondary alterations (e.g., reversion indels), upregulation of drug efflux pumps, restoration of HR via loss of 53BP1 or Shieldin complex changes, and amplification or altered expression of PARP pathway genes. Priority tests: repeat tumor biopsy for NGS that is designed to detect reversion mutations (high-depth sequencing), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for detection of emergent reversion events, and evaluation of copy-number/LOH changes. Testing should include assays sensitive to indels and frameshift reversions.

---

## Q7 (023_7)

For trial-matching and next-line therapeutic strategies after olaparib progression in a RAD51C-mutant patient, identify two rational targeted strategies (with trial/therapeutic rationale) that could be considered and list the molecular eligibility criteria you would use to prioritize enrollment.

### Answer 7

- Strategy A — PARPi + ATR inhibitor or switch to a different PARPi in combination trials: Rationale: ATR inhibition can sensitize HR-proficient or PARPi-resistant tumors by disrupting replication stress responses; clinical trials test ATRi + PARPi combinations. Eligibility: documented progression on PARPi, HRR-deficient tumor or evidence of replication stress, ECOG PS adequate, organ function within trial limits.
- Strategy B — POLQ (DNA polymerase theta) inhibitors or agents targeting HR-restoration pathways: Rationale: POLQ inhibitors are in development to exploit dependence in HR-deficient tumors and may overcome certain resistance mechanisms. Eligibility: HRD by genomic scar or biallelic loss in HR gene, measurable disease, prior PARPi exposure allowed per trial.

References/examples:
- Ongoing combination trials (example search required for trial identifiers). Review articles on PARPi combinations and ATR inhibitors. (See clinicaltrials.gov for specific active trials pairing ATRi + PARPi.)

## Q8 (023_8)

Is indefinite continuation of olaparib until progression (as planned by the treating team) aligned with current guideline and label recommendations for patients receiving PARPi monotherapy for relapsed disease, and what monitoring plan would you implement while on therapy?

### Answer 8

- Yes. Rationale: Olaparib is typically continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity per label and clinical practice; indefinite continuation is standard for maintenance settings and for single-agent therapy where clinical benefit persists. Monitoring: baseline and periodic CBC (initially every 2 weeks until stable, then monthly) because of hematologic toxicity risk; periodic clinical assessment and imaging per local practice (e.g., CT/PET every 8–12 weeks or as clinically indicated), and CA125 trends when previously informative for this patient.

---

## Q9 (023_9)

Given the patient’s age (74) and history of severe thrombocytopenia with prior platinum-containing therapy, what pre-existing comorbidities or organ-function parameters would most importantly influence ongoing olaparib dosing and safety, and how should these be managed?

### Answer 9

- Key factors: baseline bone marrow reserve (CBC trends), prior severe thrombocytopenia and transfusion dependence, renal function (olaparib dosing adjustments for moderate renal impairment per label), hepatic dysfunction (if present), concomitant drugs causing myelosuppression or strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors/inducers. Management: frequent CBC monitoring, proactive transfusion support as needed, dose interruptions/reductions per label for cytopenias, avoid strong CYP3A inhibitors or adjust olaparib dose, and multidisciplinary discussion (geriatrics/hematology) for optimization.

## Q10 (023_10)

Considering the lack of reported VAF/read depth and LOH in the published FoundationOne CDx result for this patient, how would you phrase a reasoned expert-level explanation in a tumor board for why the absence of these details matters for prognostication and possible predictive value for PARPi response?

### Answer 10

- Explanation (expert phrasing): The presence of a RAD51C alteration per se indicates potential HRR deficiency; however, the predictive strength for PARP inhibitor sensitivity is substantially higher when biallelic inactivation (e.g., high VAF consistent with clonality plus loss of the wild-type allele or high genome-wide LOH/HRD score) is documented. Without VAF and LOH data, we cannot reliably infer whether RAD51C is a truncal driver with biallelic loss (predicting greater PARPi sensitivity) versus a low-VAF subclonal event or a variant of uncertain significance. Therefore, absence of VAF/read depth and LOH limits confidence in prognosis and therapy selection and justifies either obtaining the full assay report, repeat high-depth sequencing, or orthogonal testing (germline testing, copy-number/LOH assessment) to clarify allelic status.
