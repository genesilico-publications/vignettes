## Case

A 78-year-old female with history of right breast cancer (diagnosed 2019, treated with right MRM followed by anastrozole for 4.5 years) presented with hip pain for 6 months after discontinuing anastrozole due to bilateral lower limb edema. Imaging revealed iliac bone metastasis, confirmed by biopsy showing metastatic breast cancer (ER/PR strongly positive [Allred score 8], HER2 negative, Ki-67 8-10%). NGS testing on the tumor tissue revealed somatic mutations including ESR1 L536R (VAF 38%, 1072 reads), PIK3CA H1047R (VAF 35%, 394 reads), and ATM frameshift mutation (VAF 16%, 772 reads). Current treatment includes Ribociclib, Fulvestrant and planned bisphosphonates with palliative radiotherapy.

### Answer 1

The ESR1 L536R mutation detected in this patient represents a well-established mechanism of acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy, occurring in approximately 20-40% of patients who progress on AI treatment in the metastatic setting. This mutation affects the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor, resulting in constitutive activation that allows continued estrogen signaling despite estrogen deprivation from AI therapy. Fulvestrant represents the optimal endocrine therapy choice in this ESR1-mutated patient based on robust clinical evidence, particularly from the PADA-1 trial, which demonstrated that patients with detectable ESR1 mutations in circulating tumor DNA who were randomized to fulvestrant-based therapy had significantly improved progression-free survival compared to those continuing AI therapy (median PFS 5.7 vs 3.5 months, HR 0.61). The selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) mechanism of fulvestrant directly addresses ESR1 mutation-mediated resistance by binding to and promoting degradation of both wild-type and mutant estrogen receptors, effectively overcoming the constitutive activation caused by the L536R mutation. Given this patient's high variant allele frequency (38%) indicating substantial clonal burden of the ESR1 mutation, combined with her progression after 4.5 years of anastrozole therapy, fulvestrant plus ribociclib represents the evidence-based standard approach, as other endocrine options like tamoxifen or alternative AIs would be ineffective against the constitutively active mutant receptor and would not address the underlying resistance mechanism.

### Answer 2

In this 78-year-old patient with metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer harboring concurrent ESR1 L536R and PIK3CA H1047R mutations, adding alpelisib to the current regimen represents a compelling biomarker-driven therapeutic approach. The SOLAR-1 trial demonstrated that alpelisib plus fulvestrant significantly improved progression-free survival compared to fulvestrant alone in patients with PIK3CA-mutated, hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer who had progressed on or after an aromatase inhibitor (median PFS 11.0 vs 5.7 months, HR 0.65, p<0.001). Given this patient's ESR1 mutation indicating acquired endocrine resistance and her progression on anastrozole, the combination of alpelisib (targeting the PIK3CA pathway) with fulvestrant (addressing ESR1-mediated resistance) provides dual mechanism targeting of her tumor's key resistance drivers. However, the concurrent use of ribociclib with alpelisib requires careful consideration, as this combination is not well-established and may increase toxicity risks, particularly hyperglycemia, diarrhea, and potential overlapping hematologic effects. The patient's age and prior anastrozole-related edema necessitate close monitoring for alpelisib's common adverse events, particularly hyperglycemia (requiring diabetes management protocols) and severe diarrhea. A reasonable approach would be to consider transitioning from the current CDK4/6 inhibitor-based regimen to alpelisib plus fulvestrant, leveraging the strong biomarker rationale and SOLAR-1 evidence, while implementing appropriate supportive care measures and glucose monitoring protocols given her age and comorbidity profile.

### Answer 3

The presence of an ATM frameshift mutation in this 78-year-old patient with metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer creates a significant therapeutic vulnerability through homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). ATM is a critical kinase in the DNA damage response pathway that coordinates homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks. The frameshift mutation likely results in loss of ATM function, creating a defective homologous recombination repair mechanism. This deficiency makes cancer cells vulnerable to synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors, which block base excision repair pathways, leading to accumulation of DNA damage that cannot be adequately repaired due to the compromised homologous recombination system. While the patient's advanced age of 78 years requires careful consideration of tolerability, PARP inhibitors such as olaparib or talazoparib represent viable therapeutic options for future lines of therapy after progression on current CDK4/6 inhibitor plus fulvestrant treatment and subsequent standard endocrine therapies. The EMBRACA and OlympiAD trials established efficacy of PARP inhibitors in metastatic breast cancer with germline BRCA mutations, and emerging evidence suggests similar benefit in tumors with somatic HRD mutations including ATM alterations. Given the patient's strong hormone receptor positivity (Allred score 8) and low proliferation index (Ki-67 8-10%), sequential endocrine therapies should be prioritized initially, but the ATM mutation provides a clear rationale for incorporating PARP inhibitor therapy in later treatment lines when endocrine resistance develops, potentially offering meaningful clinical benefit through exploitation of this DNA repair defect.
