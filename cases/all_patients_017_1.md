---

## Clinical vignette

- Demographics and relevant history:
  - Age: 64 years
  - Sex: Female
  - Past medical history: hysterectomy 5 years prior for benign indications; hypothyroidism (medically managed); generalized anxiety disorder (medically managed)
  - ECOG performance status: 1 at presentation

- Presenting symptoms and timeline:
  - Progressive abdominal bloating, early satiety, progressive fatigue, low back / lumbosacral pain; unintentional 8-lb (3.6-kg) weight loss
  - Examination notable for abdominal distension with fluid wave consistent with ascites and abdominal tenderness; lumbosacral pain with movement

- Diagnostic imaging and procedures:
  - Pelvic ultrasound: ~5-cm complex left ovarian mass
  - CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: complex pelvic mass, large-volume ascites, omental cake, retroperitoneal and inguinal adenopathy consistent with metastatic gynecologic primary
  - Therapeutic/diagnostic paracentesis (1200 cc) with cytology confirming malignant cells
  - Omental core biopsy histology confirming high-grade serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma

- Biomarkers and molecular testing:
  - CA-125 at diagnosis: 360 U/mL
  - Germline testing: BRCA1/2 wild-type (no germline BRCA mutation reported)
  - Somatic tumor testing: no somatic BRCA1/2 mutation detected; homologous recombination (HR) testing reported HR-proficient (no HRD). (Note: no variant allele frequencies [VAFs], read depths, copy-number details, or MSI/TMB values were provided in the source document.)
  - Other biomarker testing (IHC/FISH/PD-L1): not reported in the source material

- Stage and pathology summary:
  - Diagnosis: FIGO stage III, high-grade serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma; metastatic intra-abdominal disease (omental cake) and lymphadenopathy

- Initial management and response:
  - Primary optimal cytoreductive surgery (TAH/BSO, lymph-node dissection) achieving no visible residual intraperitoneal disease (R0)
  - Adjuvant systemic therapy: carboplatin + paclitaxel every 3 weeks for 6 cycles
  - Maintenance: bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) given after completion of chemotherapy
  - Response: CA-125 normalized after adjuvant chemotherapy; complete response by CA-125/radiographic assessment

- First recurrence and subsequent management:
  - At ~1 year while on bevacizumab maintenance, CA-125 rose; imaging confirmed progressive retroperitoneal adenopathy consistent with recurrent disease
  - Patient not considered a candidate for secondary cytoreductive surgery due to disease distribution
  - Rechallenged with platinum-based chemotherapy (carboplatin + paclitaxel q3 weeks ×6 cycles) — platinum-sensitive recurrence; achieved a partial response with persistent/enlarged lymph nodes
  - Switched to single-agent rucaparib as maintenance (switch maintenance) after partial response to platinum retreatment

- Current status (as reported):
  - On rucaparib maintenance after platinum-sensitive relapse with partial response to reinduction carboplatin/paclitaxel
  - ECOG PS at baseline remained 1 earlier in course; no explicit current organ-function lab values were provided in the source material (renal/hepatic/hematologic function not reported)

- Important missing data from the source:
  - No molecular VAFs/read-depths, specific gene-panel content, copy-number alterations, MSI or tumor mutational burden (TMB) values
  - No explicit baseline CBC/chemistry results, creatinine, bilirubin, or other organ-function metrics for dosing decisions
  - No PD-L1, IHC subtype beyond high-grade serous, or FISH data provided

- Key clinical interpretation points for test design:
  - BRCA germline and somatic wild-type and HR-proficient status reduce expected PARP-inhibitor magnitude of benefit compared with BRCA-mutant/HRD tumors, though ARIEL3 showed PFS benefit across cohorts with greatest effect in BRCA-mutant patients
  - Bevacizumab frontline maintenance confers PFS benefit in selected patients but OS benefit is not uniform across all subgroups; prior bevacizumab exposure may influence later-line antiangiogenic strategies
  - Secondary cytoreductive surgery selection depends on AGO-score-like criteria and resectability (DESKTOP III results inform selection)

## Q1 (017_1)

Given this patient’s tumor is BRCA1/2 germline and somatic wild type and homologous recombination proficient (HR-proficient), is single-agent rucaparib maintenance after a partial response to platinum rechallenge supported by high-quality evidence and regulatory approvals for recurrent platinum-sensitive disease?

### Answer 1

Yes. Rucaparib is FDA-approved for maintenance treatment of recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer in patients who are in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of BRCA mutation status; approval was based on ARIEL3 (phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled) which demonstrated statistically significant PFS improvement across prespecified cohorts (BRCA-mutant, HRD, and the intent-to-treat population). Magnitude of benefit is greatest in BRCA-mutant and HRD cohorts and attenuated in HR-proficient/BRCAwt tumors.

---

## Q2 (017_2)

Based on ARIEL3 and regulatory data, how should the clinician counsel this patient about the expected magnitude and uncertainty of benefit from rucaparib maintenance specifically because her tumor is HR-proficient and BRCA wild type, and what tumor genomic details are missing that would refine the estimate?

### Answer 2

Counseling: ARIEL3 showed PFS benefit in the ITT population but the relative and absolute benefit is largest in BRCA-mutant and HRD tumors; for HR-proficient/BRCAwt tumors the PFS benefit is smaller and more uncertain. Missing data that would refine the estimate: numeric HRD score (if available), comprehensive NGS panel results (other HRR gene alterations), variant allele fractions and read depths for detected variants, copy-number alterations (e.g., CCNE1 amplification), MSI/TMB values — any of which could identify subsets more likely to respond.

---

## Q3 (017_3)

Is this patient a candidate for secondary cytoreductive surgery at the time of her first recurrence (retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy while on bevacizumab) using contemporary randomized data and selection criteria?

### Answer 3

No. DESKTOP III and related data support secondary cytoreduction only for carefully selected patients with a high probability of complete gross resection, commonly defined by a positive AGO score (ECOG PS 0, ascites <500 mL, and complete resection at initial surgery). This patient had clinically significant ascites (1200 mL paracentesis) and disease distribution judged not amenable to surgery, making her an unfavorable candidate per AGO/DESKTOP selection criteria.

---

## Q4 (017_4)

Given prior frontline bevacizumab followed by recurrence while on bevacizumab maintenance, what is the evidence-based recommendation about using antiangiogenic therapy again in subsequent lines, and what factors should influence that choice for this patient?

### Answer 4

Evidence: Frontline bevacizumab improves PFS (GOG-0218/ICON7), with OS benefit in some subgroups; evidence for re-introduction after progression on prior bevacizumab is limited and should be individualized. Factors influencing reuse include prior duration of benefit on bevacizumab, timing of progression while on maintenance, toxicity profile (e.g., hypertension, proteinuria), available alternatives, and clinical-trial options.

---

## Q5 (017_5)

If the patient progresses while on rucaparib maintenance, what molecular mechanisms should the team test for to explain PARP-inhibitor resistance, and which assays (tumor tissue vs ctDNA) are supported by the literature?

### Answer 5

Mechanisms to evaluate: acquired BRCA1/2 reversion mutations, secondary mutations in HRR genes, replication-fork stabilization mechanisms, CCNE1 amplification, upregulation of drug-efflux pumps and other non-reversion mechanisms. Assays: repeat tumor biopsy for comprehensive NGS (to detect reversion and copy-number changes) and ctDNA sequencing (sensitive for emergent reversion mutations). BRCA reversions are strongly associated with PARP resistance and detection can guide trial selection.

---

## Q6 (017_6)

For dosing, monitoring, and safety in a 64-year-old patient receiving rucaparib, what is the recommended starting dose, key laboratory and clinical monitoring, and the principal grade ≥3 toxicities that require dose modification or discontinuation?

### Answer 6

Starting dose: rucaparib 600 mg orally twice daily (total 1200 mg/day). Monitoring: baseline and periodic CBC, liver function tests, serum creatinine, and vigilance for signs of MDS/AML; assess and manage nausea/fatigue. Principal grade ≥3 toxicities: severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, transaminase elevations, rare MDS/AML — manage with treatment interruption and dose reductions (typical reductions per label: 600 mg BID → 500 mg BID → 400 mg BID) or discontinuation if persistent.

---

## Q7 (017_7)

Considering the patient’s comorbid hypothyroidism, age 64, ECOG PS 1 and prior exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy and bevacizumab, what special pharmacologic or supportive care considerations should be applied during rucaparib maintenance?

### Answer 7

Considerations: ensure hypothyroidism is well controlled to avoid symptom conflation; review concomitant medications for CYP interactions (rucaparib has CYP inhibitory effects) and adjust as needed; monitor blood counts closely due to prior cytopenia risk; assess renal/hepatic function; counsel on MDS/AML risk; provide supportive care for anorexia/nausea/fatigue and fall-risk mitigation due to age.

---

## Q8 (017_8)

If testing again after progression demonstrates a low-level somatic BRCA1 reversion mutation with VAF 3% on ctDNA, how would that finding alter the next therapeutic strategy and trial eligibility?

### Answer 8

Interpretation: a BRCA reversion detected at low VAF on ctDNA suggests emerging PARP-resistance; confirmatory testing (repeat ctDNA or tissue biopsy) is recommended. If confirmed, PARP inhibitors are unlikely to provide durable benefit; prioritize non-PARP systemic therapies or clinical trials addressing reversion-mediated resistance (e.g., agents targeting replication-fork protection, ATR/WEE1 inhibitors, or therapies independent of HRD). Presence of reversion may exclude some PARP-rechallenge trials and support enrollment in trials for reversion-positive disease.

---

## Q9 (017_9)

Provide a recommended evidence-anchored next-line systemic therapy plan if the patient becomes symptomatic and demonstrates radiographic progression while on rucaparib, taking into account prior therapies.

### Answer 9

Recommended approach: consider non-platinum single-agent cytotoxics (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, weekly paclitaxel, topotecan, gemcitabine) ± bevacizumab depending on prior benefit/toxicity and local approvals; strong consideration for clinical-trial enrollment given BRCAwt/HR-proficient status and prior PARP exposure. If molecular testing identifies actionable alterations, pursue targeted therapy per driver alteration. Individualize decisions based on symptom burden, organ function, and patient preference.

---

## Q10 (017_10)

Identify three clinical trials or therapeutic strategies most appropriate to consider for enrollment or off-label use for this patient given BRCAwt/HR-proficient status and prior PARP exposure, with rationale and where to find trial details.

### Answer 10

1) PARP inhibitor combination trials (PARP + immunotherapy or PARP + antiangiogenic or PARP + ATR/CHK1 inhibitors) to try to induce or restore sensitivity in HR-proficient tumors; rationale: combinations can create synthetic lethality or overcome resistance. 2) Trials of ATR, WEE1, or other DDR pathway inhibitors targeting replication-fork protection or reversion-mediated resistance; rationale: address mechanisms that confer PARP resistance. 3) Trials of novel ADCs or targeted agents based on other actionable alterations (HER2, NTRK, etc.) or antibody-drug conjugates for biomarker-selected patients; rationale: use alternative targeted/ADC strategies when PARP benefit is unlikely. For trial matching: search ClinicalTrials.gov and institutional listings.
