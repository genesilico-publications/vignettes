## Case

# Case vignette: Dedifferentiation of a metastatic pancreatic gastrinoma (Frontiers in Oncology, Raoul et al., 2021)

## Key patient demographics and history

- Age / sex: 22-year-old woman at presentation (seen October 2009). No relevant comorbidities reported. No family history of MEN1; germline MEN1 testing reportedly negative.
- Social / functional: Not specifically reported; she underwent major abdominal surgery and later hepatic resection and recovered; ECOG performance status not explicitly stated.

## Presenting complaints and timeline

- October 2009: Chronic diarrhea and 8-kg weight loss. Upper endoscopy: esophageal and duodenal ulcerations. CT and EUS: 4-cm pancreatic tail tumor with multiple small (<1 cm) liver metastases.
- Biopsy/cytology at diagnosis: well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (NET), Ki-67 1% (G1 by initial cytology). Serum gastrin = 2446 UI (elevated), chromogranin A (CgA) = 1455 UI. NSE, glucagon, insulin, VIP normal. Diagnosis: sporadic metastatic pancreatic gastrinoma.

## Initial treatments and responses

- December 2009: Splenopancreatectomy with lymphadenectomy and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of three right-lobe liver metastases. Pathologic primary tumor: 7-cm pancreatic NET, well-differentiated G2, Ki-67 10%, 3/41 lymph nodes positive, mitotic rate 4/10 HPF.
- Post-op: serum gastrin and CgA decreased but remained elevated (1104 UI and 1164 UI respectively).
- Somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy: five liver metastases identified. Systemic therapy: octreotide LAR 20 mg IM monthly → rapid tumor-marker decrease.
- Three months later: liver progression (new lesions). Systemic chemotherapy with capecitabine + temozolomide administered for six 28-day cycles (capecitabine 750 mg/m2 BID days 1–14; temozolomide 200 mg/m2 days 10–14). Imaging after chemo: partial response, tumor markers normalized. Follow-up with octreotide LAR continued.

## Pregnancy and subsequent clinical course

- January 2015: Octreotide LAR stopped for pregnancy. Delivery in October 2015 (term reported as normal delivery). December 2015 (2 months postpartum): ultrasound identified progression in one liver metastasis, which grew from 15 mm to 55 mm by March 2016; other hepatic lesions remained stable.
- Imaging: MRI (March 2016) demonstrated the enlarging lesion with heterogeneous enhancement and central necrosis; 18F-FDG PET showed intense hypermetabolism in that lesion (SUVmax 22.8) with no other FDG-avid disease.
- Biopsy of the enlarging lesion (2016): mixed histology with an area of well- to moderately differentiated NET (Ki-67 14%, G2) surrounding a poorly differentiated large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) component with Ki-67 ≈ 60% (poorly differentiated). Rising NSE level correlated with transformation.

## Further systemic therapy and surgical management

- The capecitabine/temozolomide regimen was reintroduced but failed to control the rapidly progressive lesion.
- After right portal vein embolization, right hepatectomy performed in January 2017 removing both lesions (75 mm necrotic lesion and a separate 23 mm lesion >20 mm apart).
- Pathology of the resected liver lesions:
  - Larger lesion: poorly differentiated large-cell NEC; compact architecture; positive for CD56, TTF-1, p53; partial chromogranin A and synaptophysin positivity; mitotic index >20 mitoses/2 mm2; Ki-67 >80%.
  - Smaller lesion: well-differentiated NET; glandular proliferation expressing synaptophysin/chromogranin/CD56; Ki-67 <1%; absent mitoses.

## Molecular/genomic findings (exome NGS; FoundationOne® CDx)

- Dormant well-differentiated metastasis (23 mm): microsatellite stable (MSS), low tumor mutational burden (TMB 3 mutations/Mb). No actionable/major gene alterations reported; only six variants of uncertain significance: BRCA2 (K2791N), FOXL2 (V141I), KDR (R1229Q), KLHL6 (M313I), MAP3K13 (R458H), NOTCH1 (N2805). (No VAF/read-depth data provided in the report.)

- Progressive poorly differentiated metastasis (75 mm): microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) status; very high TMB 153 mutations/Mb. Multiple somatic mutations detected including (reporting nomenclature as given): MLH1 splice site (207 + 1G>A, Q510*), MEN1 splice site (927 + 1G>A), BCL2 (E165K), BCORL1 (Q606*), DAXX splice site (1039 + 1G>A), ERBB4 (R50H), HNF1A (G292fs*25), KDM5C (R68fs*5), MLL2 splice site (5645 -1G>A), PPP2R2A splice site (180 + 1G>A), TP53 (P191del, R280K). The mutational pattern contained predominantly G>A substitutions and corresponded to mutational signature 11 associated with temozolomide exposure. MLH1 alteration was presumed somatic and corresponded to the MSI-H phenotype (no germline Lynch syndrome reported in earlier workup, although authors recommend somatic origin).

- Note: The report does not provide variant allele frequencies (VAF) or sequencing read depths for the listed alterations; these metrics were not available in the publication.

## Biomarker/Immunohistochemistry

- Ki-67 indices: primary 10% (G2); progressive lesion contained NEC component Ki-67 >80%; dormant lesion Ki-67 <1%.
- IHC on NEC: CD56+, TTF-1+, p53 overexpression; partial chromogranin A and synaptophysin positivity in NEC; well-differentiated lesion positive for neuroendocrine markers.
- Somatostatin-receptor imaging: prior 68Ga-DOTATOC PET (January 2014) negative for significant uptake; at time of progression 18F-FDG PET was highly positive for the transformed lesion (SUV 22.8) indicating metabolic dedifferentiation and likely relative loss of somatostatin receptor expression in that component.

## Outcomes and current status

- Right hepatectomy achieved complete macroscopic resection of both lesions. At 41 months after resection (June 2020), imaging remained stable with no evidence of recurrent or progressive disease.

## Clinical interpretation (oncology-specialist tone)

- This is an instructive example of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in pancreatic NETs, with divergent evolution of two metastases: one molecularly quiet, well-differentiated and indolent (MSS, TMB low), and one that underwent high-grade transformation to MSI-H, hypermutated NEC with loss of MMR function (MLH1 alteration) and multiple additional driver and tumor-suppressor alterations (MEN1, TP53, DAXX). The hypermutational profile and predominance of G>A substitutions suggest a temozolomide-associated mutational signature (signature 11) as a plausible contributing mechanism, although causality cannot be definitively proven from a single case.

- The case supports aggressive local therapy (surgical resection) for isolated focal progression in a patient otherwise with indolent metastatic NET disease, and underscores the utility of lesion-specific biopsy, FDG/SSTR imaging to phenotype lesions, and lesion-specific genomic profiling to inform systemic options (e.g., MSI/TMB-directed immunotherapy) and trial selection.

## Q1 (033_1)

Given the resected progressing hepatic lesion has somatic MLH1 alteration with MSI-H status and TMB = 153 muts/Mb, would pembrolizumab be an evidence-based systemic treatment option if the lesion were unresectable, and what regulatory/level-of-evidence supports this recommendation? Explain using this patient’s molecular data.

### Answer 1

Yes. Pembrolizumab has tissue-agnostic approvals for unresectable/metastatic MSI-H/dMMR tumors and for TMB-H (≥10 muts/Mb) solid tumors (FDA). The patient’s lesion is MSI-H and extremely TMB-high (153 muts/Mb), both biomarkers that predict higher probability of response to PD-1 blockade. Although data specific to high-grade NEC are limited, regulatory approvals and KEYNOTE-158 evidence support pembrolizumab in this biomarker context; therefore, if unresectable/progressive, anti–PD-1 therapy is an evidence-based option.

## Q2 (033_2)

How should the treating team interpret the potential causal role of prior temozolomide exposure in the hypermutated MSI-H NEC (mutational signature 11 predominance), and what is the biologic plausibility linking temozolomide to this tumor’s genomic pattern? Relate the interpretation specifically to this patient’s prior capecitabine/temozolomide exposure (dates, cycles) and the mutational findings reported.

### Answer 2

Temozolomide is a biologically plausible contributor. TMZ causes O6-alkylguanine lesions that, when unrepaired or when MMR is defective, lead to G>A transitions and hypermutation. The tumor’s signature matches signature 11 (predominant G>A substitutions), described after TMZ exposure in gliomas and associated with hypermutation. This patient had six cycles of capecitabine/temozolomide (2009–2010) and retreatment before hepatectomy; the timeline and signature-compatible pattern support a plausible TMZ role, but causality is not proven in a single case. The acquired MLH1 splice mutation in the NEC provides a mechanistic bridge to MMR-deficiency-driven hypermutation.

## Q3 (033_3)

Given the tumor’s MLH1 splice alteration reported only in the progressing lesion and earlier germline MEN1 testing was negative, what is the recommended genetic workup now for this patient (germline vs somatic testing), and how would results change management? Include rationale referencing the patient’s data (somatic MLH1, MSI-H, absent germline MEN1 earlier).

### Answer 3

Recommended workup: (1) perform germline testing for Lynch-spectrum genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM) if not already done to exclude hereditary Lynch syndrome; (2) perform tumor-normal paired sequencing to confirm MLH1 is somatic; (3) assess MLH1 promoter methylation to detect epigenetic silencing. If germline MLH1 is found → cascade testing and long-term cancer surveillance for patient and relatives; if somatic → no Lynch syndrome management required, but MSI-H status still guides therapy. The report's data suggest a somatic MLH1 event, but confirmation is required.

## Q4 (033_4)

In this patient with an isolated rapidly progressing FDG-avid hepatic metastasis and otherwise indolent disease, was the decision to perform local therapy (right hepatectomy after portal vein embolization) consistent with contemporary evidence-based practice, and what outcomes data support local treatment for focal progression in metastatic NETs? Answer with specifics tied to this case.

### Answer 4

Yes. Contemporary series and expert consensus support aggressive local therapy (resection, ablation, embolization) for isolated focal progression in patients with otherwise controlled metastatic NETs to achieve durable local control and potential long-term survival. Al-Toubah et al. (Endocr Relat Cancer 2019) reported favorable outcomes after local treatments for focal progression. In this patient, resection removed the FDG-avid, high-grade focus and resulted in at least 41 months of disease-free status, consistent with favorable outcomes from selected series.

---

## Q5 (033_5)

Considering the differential somatostatin receptor (SSTR) imaging (68Ga-DOTATOC negative in 2014) and high FDG uptake in the transformed lesion (SUVmax 22.8), would peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with 177Lu-DOTATATE have been appropriate for the progressive lesion at the time of transformation? Explain with reference to this patient’s imaging and histology.

### Answer 5

Likely not appropriate for the transformed NEC component. PRRT efficacy requires sufficient SSTR expression; the progressive lesion showed high FDG uptake and prior negative DOTATOC, and histology demonstrated poorly differentiated NEC, which predicts poor PRRT response. PRRT could be considered for other SSTR-positive indolent metastases if they demonstrate sufficient uptake, but not for the hypermetabolic NEC focus.

---

## Q6 (033_6)

If the patient developed unresectable, progressive disease after hepatectomy and remained MSI-H/TMB-high in recurrent tissue, what clinical trial classes or targeted therapy strategies would be most rational to prioritize, given her genomic profile (MSI-H, MEN1 somatic splice site alteration, TP53 mutations, prior alkylator exposure)? Include at least two classes and the biomarker rationale.

### Answer 6

Prioritize: (1) Immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti–PD-1/PD-L1) or PD-1 combination trials given MSI-H and very high TMB — strong biomarker rationale and regulatory precedent (pembrolizumab); (2) early-phase trials exploiting vulnerabilities of hypermutant/MMR-deficient tumors (combinations with other immunomodulators, DNA damage response targeting, or agents exploiting synthetic lethality). MEN1 and TP53 lack approved direct targeted therapies; consider trials targeting cell-cycle or epigenetic vulnerabilities. Enrollment in genomically matched or immunotherapy trials is recommended.

---

## Q7 (033_7)

How should the multidisciplinary team integrate lesion-specific Ki-67 heterogeneity (NEC Ki-67 >80% vs other lesion Ki-67 <1%) into decisions about systemic therapy choice and trial eligibility, and what is the recommended histology-driven approach for systemic therapy when both well-differentiated NET and poorly differentiated NEC components are present? Relate to this patient’s performance and organ-status implications (resectable solitary progression, otherwise indolent disease).

### Answer 7

High Ki-67 and poorly differentiated histology should drive NEC-directed systemic therapy (platinum-based regimens), while well-differentiated NETs are managed with SSAs, targeted agents, or temozolomide-based regimens. When both components coexist, treat the clinically and biologically dominant component. In this patient, the solitary high-grade NEC focus was the dominant threat and justified lesion-directed resection; systemic NEC paradigms would be used if systemic therapy were needed (e.g., platinum-etoposide).

---

## Q8 (033_8)

The original FoundationOne® report did not include variant allele frequencies (VAFs) or sequencing read-depths. Explain the clinical relevance of obtaining VAF/read-depth for key alterations in this case (MLH1, MEN1, TP53) and how the presence or absence of high VAF would modify interpretation about clonal status and potential therapeutic actionability.

### Answer 8

VAF/read-depth informs clonality: high VAF suggests clonal (early) events present in most tumor cells and supports their relevance as drivers (e.g., MLH1 and TP53 as dominant features), which strengthens therapeutic/biomarker interpretation (immunotherapy for MSI-H). Low VAF implies subclonality and intratumor heterogeneity, predicting mixed responses. For MEN1, high VAF would suggest a driver event; absence of VAF limits evolutionary inference. Tumor-normal paired sequencing with read-depth is recommended to resolve clonality.

---

## Q9 (033_9)

If a relapse occurred exclusively in the previously dormant MSS lesion (TMB 3 muts/Mb) while the NEC component remained resected, how should systemic therapy be selected compared with treatment if the NEC recurred, and would immune checkpoint blockade be indicated for the MSS lesion? Justify using the patient’s molecular parameters.

### Answer 9

For relapse confined to the MSS, low-TMB lesion, checkpoint inhibitors are unlikely to be effective as monotherapy. Standard NET-directed options should be prioritized (SSAs if SSTR-positive, targeted agents such as sunitinib/everolimus for pancreatic NETs per guidelines, PRRT if SSTR-positive). If NEC (MSI-H/TMB-high) recurred, immunotherapy would be prioritized. Thus therapy depends on lesion-specific histology and molecular profile.

---

## Q10 (033_10)

List three specific actionable clinical-management steps you would document in the patient’s record at the time of multidisciplinary review following the finding of a mixed NEC (MSI-H/TMB-high) and indolent MSS lesion, explaining the reasoning tied to the patient’s data in each step.

### Answer 10

Example actions: (1) Recommend lesion-directed therapy (surgical resection) for the solitary progressing NEC because it is FDG-avid, rapidly growing, and histologically high-grade, and resection may be curative or yield prolonged control (document rationale). (2) Order germline Lynch-panel testing and tumor-normal paired sequencing + MLH1 promoter methylation testing to classify MLH1 alteration (somatic vs germline) since results change family counseling and surveillance. (3) If unresectable/systemic MSI-H/TMB-high progression occurs, prioritize PD-1 inhibitor therapy or enrollment in immunotherapy trials, documenting biomarker rationale (MSI-H, TMB 153) and noting lack of VAF/read-depth as a limitation.
