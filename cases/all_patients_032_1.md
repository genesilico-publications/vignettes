# Case vignette: Metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a novel somatic BRCA2 p.I2315T (c.6944T>C)

## Clinical summary (chronological)
- Demographics: 57-year-old Chinese man; family history notable for gastric cancer in mother (age 65) and lung cancer in father. No prior significant comorbidities or constitutional symptoms reported on presentation.

- Presentation and staging: In January 2019 a routine physical examination identified a low-density liver shadow. Contrast CT in January 2019 demonstrated a 5.0 × 3.0 cm mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas with multiple hypodense hepatic metastases consistent with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at diagnosis.

- Baseline biomarkers: Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were markedly elevated during early treatment: CEA rose to 270.35 ng/mL and CA19-9 to 352.56 U/mL at progression on first-line therapy, with serial declines after targeted therapy (see timeline below).

- First-line therapy and response: Began gemcitabine 1.4 g once weekly plus nab-paclitaxel 200 mg every 2 weeks in January 2019 per institutional/NCCN-based practice. At 6-week re-evaluation (March 2019) the patient had radiographic progressive disease (enlargement of primary pancreatic and hepatic lesions) and concordant rise in tumor markers (PD after ~2 months).

- Molecular profiling (tumor and plasma NGS): Targeted 425-gene panel on tumor tissue and plasma (dates per timeline). Key somatic alterations (with mutant allele frequencies [MAF] reported in the manuscript):
  - BRCA2 p.I2315T (c.6944T>C): MAF 39.5% (tumor biopsy), 28.0% (plasma); absent in matched white blood cells (germline testing negative) → classified as somatic in this report. Read depth was not reported in the manuscript.
  - KRAS p.Q61R (c.182A>G): MAF 43.2% (tumor), 27.4% (plasma)
  - TP53 p.R110del (c.329_331delGTC): MAF 81.6% (tumor), 37.4% (plasma)
  - APC p.S1465RfsX9 (c.4393_4394dupAG): MAF 71.7% (tumor), 26.7% (plasma)
  - CCNE1 gene amplification: 27.4-fold (tumor), 16.0-fold (plasma)
  - Additional gene amplifications and alterations (PIK3CA, SOX2, STMN1, TERC, TUBB3, PKHD1 truncation) at lower fold changes/MAFs (see Table 1 of source).

- Biomarker/IHC/FISH: No immunohistochemistry (IHC) or FISH PD-L1, mismatch repair (MMR)/MSI, or tumor mutational burden (TMB) data were reported in the source manuscript.

- Therapeutic strategy after progression on gemcitabine + nab‑paclitaxel: Because of the novel somatic BRCA2 p.I2315T mutation, clinicians administered olaparib in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy and then as maintenance/monotherapy: olaparib combined with modified FOLFIRINOX components (irinotecan + oxaliplatin + S-1) and with irinotecan + oxaliplatin in overlapping regimens, followed by olaparib monotherapy. Exact dosing of olaparib used in the report was not provided; standard olaparib dosing per regulatory labeling is 300 mg PO twice daily (see references).

- Clinical course with olaparib-based therapy: The patient demonstrated a marked radiographic and biochemical response after initiating olaparib-containing regimens: partial response (PR) for approximately 3 months, stable disease (SD) for ~2 months, then acquired progression while on olaparib monotherapy. The reported progression-free survival (PFS) on olaparib-containing strategy was ~6.5 months from initiation.

- Toxicities and organ function: The case report did not provide detailed adverse-event grading, laboratory organ-function values (baseline creatinine, bilirubin, hepatic transaminases), or ECOG performance status. These data were therefore not available in the manuscript and should be sought when applying decisions to a real patient.

- Interpretation / key points for clinicians:
  - The tumor harbored a novel somatic BRCA2 point mutation (p.I2315T) with high tumor MAF (39.5%) and detectable plasma MAF (28%), absent in germline WBC testing, supporting a somatic origin.
  - The temporal association of marked radiographic and biomarker responses after initiation of olaparib-containing therapy in this single-patient report supports that this BRCA2 variant may have caused homologous-recombination deficiency (HRD) and PARP inhibitor sensitivity in this tumor.
  - The POLO phase 3 randomized trial established maintenance olaparib benefit in patients with germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer who had not progressed on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy; regulatory approvals and guideline recommendations are primarily for germline BRCA alterations. Evidence for somatic BRCA alterations is limited to case series, retrospective analyses, and basket/expansion-cohort data; somatic BRCA alterations can be actionable but are not interchangeably equivalent to germline alterations in regulatory labeling.

## Q1 (032_1)

Given the reported tumor variant allele frequency (MAF) of BRCA2 p.I2315T of 39.5% in the biopsy and 28.0% in plasma with the variant absent in white blood cells, how should this variant be classified (somatic vs germline, clonal vs subclonal), and what is the implication for homologous-recombination deficiency (HRD) inference in this patient?

### Answer 1

This BRCA2 p.I2315T variant is somatic (absent in WBC/germline testing). A tumor MAF of ~39.5% at a diploid locus typically indicates a heterozygous somatic variant present in a large fraction of tumor cells (consistent with clonal or dominant-subclone status), and the plasma MAF (28%) corroborates tumor shedding. Functional HRD inference from a single point mutation requires caution because missense/nonsynonymous variants can be VUS; however, high tumor MAF plus the observed clinical response to olaparib in this case make functional HRD plausible. Definitive assignment of HRD requires orthogonal evidence (biallelic inactivation/LOH at BRCA2, functional RAD51 assays, or HRD genomic scars). Read depth was not reported in the manuscript and would strengthen technical confidence.

## Q2 (032_2)

Is olaparib an FDA-approved, guideline-recommended standard therapy for this patient’s tumor based on the reported somatic BRCA2 p.I2315T, and was the clinical use described in the case report consistent with regulatory labeling?

### Answer 2

Olaparib is FDA-approved for maintenance therapy in metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma only for patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutations who have not progressed on at least 16 weeks of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (POLO trial population). The POLO label and approvals require germline BRCA mutation; therefore, using olaparib for a somatic BRCA2 point mutation in pancreatic cancer is off-label. The case report describes off-label use with clinical benefit; this is hypothesis-generating and clinically informative but does not alter the regulatory indication.

## Q3 (032_3)

For a 57-year-old patient who progressed on gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel and harbors a somatic BRCA2 variant with high tumor MAF, what is the evidence-based preferred systemic sequencing and rationale regarding platinum-containing chemotherapy and PARP inhibitor therapy in 2026?

### Answer 3

For fit patients with BRCA-associated HRD, platinum-containing regimens (FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine–cisplatin) are preferred first-line options because HR-deficient tumors are more likely to be platinum-sensitive. The highest-level evidence (POLO) supports PARP inhibitor maintenance after disease control from platinum chemotherapy in germline BRCA carriers. For somatic BRCA2, centers commonly consider platinum therapy and may consider PARP inhibitors in clinical trials or compassionate/off-label settings after multidisciplinary review and informed consent. Because this patient did not receive initial platinum therapy and progressed on gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel, the later clinical benefit from olaparib in this single case is supportive but lower-level evidence than randomized data.

---

## Q4 (032_4)

How does the high CCNE1 amplification (reported 27.4-fold in tumor) modulate expected sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors, and how should this inform treatment planning for this patient?

### Answer 4

High-level CCNE1 amplification has been associated (in other tumor types such as high-grade serous ovarian cancer) with primary resistance to platinum chemotherapy and reduced benefit from PARP inhibitors. Mechanistically, CCNE1-driven cell-cycle deregulation and replication-stress pathways can confer resistance to HRD-targeted therapies. In this patient, the CCNE1 amplification is a plausible contributor to the limited durability of response (~6.5 months) and should prompt consideration of clinical trials targeting replication stress (CHK1/ATR inhibitors) or combination strategies rather than relying solely on single-agent PARP maintenance.

## Q5 (032_5)

At progression on olaparib monotherapy after ~6.5 months, what are the most likely molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to PARP inhibition in BRCA2-mutant tumors, and what diagnostic tests should be prioritized to identify them in this patient?

### Answer 5

Common resistance mechanisms include secondary (reversion) BRCA2 mutations that restore open reading frame/function, restoration of homologous recombination via compensatory alterations, epigenetic reversal, increased drug efflux, and restoration of PARylation. Diagnostic priorities: repeat tumor biopsy with comprehensive NGS optimized to detect indels/reversions, high-sensitivity plasma ctDNA NGS for detection of BRCA2 reversion alleles and other resistance events, and functional HR assays (RAD51 foci) or genomic scar/LOH assessment if available. ctDNA often detects reversion mutations earlier than imaging; paired tissue and ctDNA testing are recommended.

## Q6 (032_6)

Which interventional clinical trial strategies in 2026 would be most appropriate to consider for this patient (somatic BRCA2 p.I2315T, CCNE1amp), and what trial inclusion criteria elements should be confirmed before referral?

### Answer 6

Appropriate strategies: (a) PARP inhibitor trials that accept somatic BRCA1/2 or HRD-positive tumors (tumor-agnostic or pancreatic-specific); (b) combinations of PARP + ATR/CHK1/WEE1 inhibitors or PARP + immune checkpoint inhibitors to overcome resistance; (c) trials targeting CCNE1-amplified tumors (CHK1 inhibitors, CDK2 inhibitors, replication-stress directed therapies). Before referral, confirm documented somatic BRCA2 alteration with VAF and LOH/zygosity if possible, prior therapy lines and platinum exposure, ECOG/organ function, measurable disease, and prior toxicity. Use clinicaltrials.gov and institutional matching.

## Q7 (032_7)

How should the KRAS p.Q61R co-mutation (tumor MAF 43.2%) influence prognosis, eligibility for targeted therapy, or enrollment in precision trials for this patient?

### Answer 7

KRAS Q61R is an activating RAS mutation associated with aggressive clinical biology. Current approved KRAS inhibitors target specific hotspots (e.g., G12C) and do not cover Q61R, so no direct approved targeted therapy exists for Q61R. However, KRAS Q61R informs prognosis and trial selection—enabling eligibility for trials targeting downstream MAPK pathway effectors (MEK/ERK) or novel RAS-targeting strategies, and should be included in precision matching. KRAS status does not preclude PARP inhibition but may influence trial choices and expectations.

## Q8 (032_8)

Given the absence of reported MSI/MMR or PD-L1 data in the case report, what is the recommended approach to evaluate candidacy for immune checkpoint blockade in metastatic pancreatic cancer for this patient?

### Answer 8

Evaluate MMR/MSI status (IHC or PCR/NGS) and determine TMB via comprehensive genomic profiling. Immune checkpoint blockade is standard for MSI-H/dMMR metastatic pancreatic cancer (rare) and may be considered for high TMB in specific regulatory contexts; PD-L1 alone is not an established indicator for single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. If MSI-H or TMB-high is found, immunotherapy or trial enrollment is appropriate; otherwise, single-agent checkpoint inhibitors are unlikely to be effective.

---

## Q9 (032_9)

If this patient developed moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–50 mL/min) while receiving olaparib, how should olaparib dosing be adjusted according to current prescribing information?

### Answer 9

Standard olaparib dosing is 300 mg PO twice daily (tablets) for the approved indications. For moderate renal impairment (CrCl 31–50 mL/min) dose reduction is recommended per current LYNPARZA prescribing information; consult the most recent label because recommendations differ by formulation and indication. For severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤30 mL/min) olaparib should be used with caution or avoided; always consult up-to-date prescribing information and pharmacy for exact reduced dosing and monitoring.

## Q10 (032_10)

How can serial plasma BRCA2 MAF (ctDNA) be used to monitor response and predict progression on PARP inhibitors in this patient, and what thresholds or patterns are evidence-based for actionable change?

### Answer 10

Serial ctDNA of the patient-specific BRCA2 p.I2315T variant can track tumor burden: a decline in ctDNA VAF usually correlates with radiographic/clinical response, while a rising or re-emerging VAF above the nadir may precede clinical progression and should trigger repeat imaging and ctDNA NGS to evaluate resistance mechanisms (e.g., reversion mutations). Absolute VAF thresholds are not universally validated; clinicians use relative changes (e.g., >2-fold consistent rise from nadir or return to pre-treatment levels) and assay-specific limits of detection. High-sensitivity, standardized assays with consistent sampling intervals are essential; in this patient baseline plasma MAF 28% is measurable and suitable for longitudinal monitoring.
