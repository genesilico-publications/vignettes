## Case

This is a case of a 50-year-old female with bilateral breast cancer who has demonstrated significant evolution in disease biology. Initially diagnosed in 2023 with bilateral ER/PR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer (Grade 2), she progressed to develop triple-negative disease in the right breast (Grade 3) by April 2025, suggesting clonal evolution. NGS testing revealed pathogenic mutations in AKT1 (VAF 55%, 5,249 reads), ARID1A (VAF 3.39%, 9,121 reads), and NF1 (VAF 6.58%, 4,836 reads). Recent imaging shows mixed response with regression in left breast lesions but progression in right breast. The patient is currently on Gemcitabine-based therapy with severe anemia (Hb 3.21 g/dL) requiring attention.

## Q1 (f4c03460-dbe5-435a-8a3e-12ff42e05c48)



### Answer 1

Given this patient's evolution from ER/PR-positive to triple-negative breast cancer with an AKT1 E17K mutation (VAF 55%), targeted therapy options should focus on AKT pathway inhibition, particularly capivasertib, which has demonstrated efficacy in the CAPITELLO-291 trial for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients with AKT mutations who have progressed on endocrine therapy. However, the patient's current triple-negative status presents a unique challenge, as capivasertib is primarily studied in HR-positive disease, and the clonal evolution suggests aggressive biology that may have moved beyond dependence on the AKT pathway alone. The high variant allele frequency of the AKT1 mutation indicates this is likely a dominant clone, making AKT inhibition theoretically relevant, but clinical data supporting capivasertib in TNBC with AKT mutations is limited. Given the triple-negative transformation, immediate priorities should include PD-L1 testing to evaluate eligibility for immunotherapy combinations (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy as per KEYNOTE-355), addressing the severe anemia (Hb 3.21 g/dL) which may limit treatment options, and considering the mixed response pattern suggesting heterogeneous disease biology. The presence of additional mutations (ARID1A and NF1) at lower VAFs suggests genomic instability that might favor immunotherapy approaches over targeted monotherapy, though consultation with a precision oncology team regarding off-label capivasertib use in combination with standard TNBC therapy could be considered given the high AKT1 VAF and the mechanism of resistance evolution from prior hormone therapy.

### Answer 2

The presence of ARID1A loss-of-function mutation in this patient with triple-negative breast cancer creates a synthetic lethal opportunity through targeting homologous recombination repair (HRR) deficiency. ARID1A, a tumor suppressor gene encoding a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, plays a crucial role in DNA damage response and HRR pathway maintenance. Loss of ARID1A function creates vulnerability to PARP inhibition through synthetic lethality, as cells become dependent on alternative DNA repair mechanisms. In this case, with documented ARID1A mutation (VAF 3.39%) in the context of evolving triple-negative disease showing progression on current gemcitabine-based therapy, PARP inhibitor therapy represents a rational therapeutic approach. Clinical evidence supporting this strategy includes data from basket trials like TAPUR, which demonstrated activity of olaparib in ARID1A-mutated solid tumors, and preclinical studies showing enhanced PARP inhibitor sensitivity in ARID1A-deficient breast cancer models. Additionally, the combination of PARP inhibitors with immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown promise in TNBC, particularly relevant given this patient's aggressive disease biology with clonal evolution. Given the patient's current severe anemia (Hb 3.21 g/dL) and mixed response to gemcitabine, transitioning to olaparib monotherapy or considering combination approaches targeting the ARID1A-deficient synthetic lethal vulnerability would be clinically justified, while addressing the current hematologic toxicity and potentially offering improved tolerability compared to continued cytotoxic chemotherapy.

### Answer 3

The concurrent presence of NF1 and AKT1 mutations in this patient carries significant prognostic implications and directly impacts treatment sequencing decisions. AKT1 mutations, particularly the E17K hotspot mutation, activate the PI3K/AKT pathway and are associated with endocrine resistance in ER-positive breast cancer, as demonstrated in studies including the BOLERO-2 trial analysis and subsequent genomic profiling studies. The co-occurrence of NF1 mutations, which function as tumor suppressors in the RAS pathway, creates a dual pathway activation scenario (PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK) that confers an aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis, particularly relevant given this patient's clonal evolution from hormone receptor-positive to triple-negative disease. This molecular profile suggests inherent resistance to standard endocrine therapies and increased likelihood of treatment resistance overall. For treatment sequencing, the high variant allele frequency of AKT1 (55%) indicates this is likely a founding mutation, while the lower VAF of NF1 (6.58%) suggests subclonal evolution, potentially explaining the mixed treatment response observed. Given the severe anemia and disease progression in the right breast, consideration should be given to AKT inhibitor-based combinations if returning to hormone receptor-targeted therapy for the left breast, while the triple-negative right breast disease may require more aggressive cytotoxic approaches or immunotherapy combinations, recognizing that the dual pathway mutations predict shorter progression-free survival and overall survival compared to wild-type tumors.
