# Case vignette — NEJM Case 7-2020: 52-Year-Old Man with a Mass in the Left Breast

## Key demographics and baseline data
- Age/sex: 52-year-old man
- Ancestry: Ashkenazi Jewish
- Occupation/social: Accountant, lives with wife and two children
- Relevant past medical history: left-sided deafness since age 20 (post-viral), seasonal rhinitis; prior vasectomy
- Family history: multiple relatives with breast cancer (father, paternal aunt), pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and other malignancies concentrated on paternal side (see pedigree in source)
- Medications: fexofenadine, mometasone nasal spray
- Tobacco/alcohol: never-smoker, rare alcohol use

## Presentation and timeline
- T = -7 weeks: Patient palpated a nontender lump in the left breast.
- T = -4 weeks: Presented to primary care; mass noted (~2 cm), referred for imaging.
- T = -19 days before current evaluation: Bilateral diagnostic mammography and targeted ultrasound performed.
- Imaging consistent with suspicious left retroareolar mass; core-needle biopsy and FNA of suspicious axillary node performed.
- T = +9 days after clinic evaluation: Left modified radical mastectomy performed (tumor resection and axillary dissection).
- Adjuvant therapy: dose-dense doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide x4 cycles followed by paclitaxel x4 cycles; chest-wall and left supraclavicular radiation; adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen for 5 years with an additional 5 years (total 10 years) per treating team.

## Clinical exam and performance status
- At initial evaluation: afebrile, HR 91 bpm, BP 126/90 mm Hg, O2 sat 98% on room air.
- Height/weight/BMI: 185.4 cm, 86.6 kg, BMI 25.2
- Performance status: patient reported feeling generally well; documented activities consistent with ECOG 0–1 (not explicitly stated in case report).

## Staging and disease burden
- Imaging (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis and bone scan): no distant metastatic disease at staging workup.
- Surgical pathology: invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3 (high-grade), greatest diameter 2.1 cm (pathologic T1c), metastatic carcinoma in 1 of 19 axillary lymph nodes (pN1a) → pathologic stage pT1cN1a (AJCC staging as reported in case record).
- Margins: tumor approaches posterior margin along a broad front; narrow posterior margin (<1 mm) noted on specimen.

## Pathology and biomarkers
- Histology: invasive ductal carcinoma with focal tubular differentiation; high mitotic index (~8–10/HPF) and loss of glandular differentiation.
- Hormone receptors: strongly estrogen-receptor (ER) positive and progesterone-receptor (PR) positive on IHC (qualitative as reported); HER2 IHC negative and FISH negative for amplification.
- Node status: 1/19 positive nodes with complete replacement of the involved node; no central necrosis.

## Molecular/genomic testing
- Germline testing: pathogenic BRCA2 founder mutation 6174delT identified (Ashkenazi Jewish founder variant).
- Somatic NGS data, variant allele fraction (VAF), read depth, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and MSI status: not reported in the case document (testing at that time was limited to BRCA1/2).

## Laboratory and organ-function data
- Serum calcium: 11.1 mg/dL (mild hypercalcemia)
- Total bilirubin: 1.5 mg/dL (mild elevation)
- AST: 46 U/L, ALT: 46 U/L (near upper limit or mildly elevated)
- Alkaline phosphatase, renal function, electrolytes, and CBC otherwise within reference range as reported.

## Prior treatments, responses, and toxicities
- Surgery: left modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection (19 nodes removed)
- Radiation: adjuvant irradiation of chest wall and left supraclavicular area; no axillary radiotherapy
- Chemotherapy: dose-dense doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide x4 → paclitaxel x4 (adjuvant); regimen and schedule described in case report
- Endocrine therapy: tamoxifen initiated adjuvantly, completed 5 years with decision to continue for additional 5 years due to high-risk features; patient tolerated tamoxifen without complication and remained adherent according to report

## Genetic and familial implications
- Germline BRCA2 6174delT (pathogenic Ashkenazi founder mutation) — obligate autosomal dominant inheritance
- Cascade testing recommended for first-degree relatives (sister, children when adults); prostate and pancreatic screening counseling recommended for BRCA2 carriers

## Key clinical issues and considerations for precision oncology
- High-grade ER+/PR+, HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer in a male BRCA2 germline carrier, pathologic stage pT1cN1a, treated with standard-of-care surgery, anthracycline/taxane chemotherapy, radiation, and tamoxifen.
- Relevant contemporary questions include: whether this patient would meet criteria for adjuvant PARP inhibitor therapy (eg, olaparib per OlympiA trial), optimal endocrine strategy in men (tamoxifen vs aromatase inhibitor), genetic-counseling and cascade testing implications, BRCA2-specific surveillance (prostate and pancreatic screening), and implications for systemic therapy choices at recurrence (PARP inhibitor sensitivity, platinum options).

## Q1 (010_1)

Based on this patient’s pathologic features (pT1c [2.1 cm], pN1a [1/19], ER+/PR+, HER2−) and known germline BRCA2 6174delT, does he meet contemporary (post‑2021) FDA‑approved criteria for adjuvant olaparib (Lynparza) as defined by the OlympiA trial and the Lynparza adjuvant indication? Please justify your answer with the specific eligibility thresholds.

### Answer 1

No. The FDA‑approved adjuvant indication for olaparib (based on OlympiA) applies to adults with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA1/2 mutations and HER2‑negative high‑risk early breast cancer who have received (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. OlympiA’s high‑risk definition for HR‑positive disease required either: (a) receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with residual disease and CPS‑EG score ≥3, or (b) treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy and ≥4 positive pathologic lymph nodes. This patient received adjuvant chemotherapy but had only 1 positive node (pN1a), so he does not meet the ≥4‑node threshold and therefore would not meet the labeled adjuvant olaparib indication under current criteria.

---

## Q2 (010_2)

Considering his ER+/PR+ status and male sex, what is the guideline‑preferred adjuvant endocrine therapy for this patient and what is the evidence base supporting that choice in men? Include recommended duration and key toxicity counseling points relevant to a practicing oncologist.

### Answer 2

Tamoxifen is the guideline‑preferred adjuvant endocrine therapy for men with hormone‑receptor–positive breast cancer. ASCO and other guideline bodies recommend offering tamoxifen to men for at least 5 years; extrapolation from female data and observational cohorts supports benefit. Tamoxifen adverse effects that require counseling include hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, mood changes, weight gain, and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism; adherence is critical because nonadherence is associated with worse survival in men. Because this patient tolerated tamoxifen without complication and had high‑risk features, continuation (and consideration of extended duration per individualized risk/benefit discussion) is appropriate.

---

## Q3 (010_3)

What BRCA2‑specific surveillance recommendations should be discussed with this patient now (8 years after initial diagnosis he is recurrence‑free per the case), including prostate and pancreatic cancer screening thresholds and rationale? Indicate guideline sources.

### Answer 3

For male BRCA2 carriers, guidelines (NCCN/other expert groups) recommend offering earlier prostate cancer screening beginning at about age 45 (individualize earlier if strong family history) given increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer. Pancreatic cancer screening is suggested for BRCA2 carriers who have a family history of pancreatic cancer; screening should be performed in high‑risk programs (MRI/MRCP and/or endoscopic ultrasound). Cascade testing of first‑degree relatives is recommended.

---

## Q4 (010_4)

If this patient developed metastatic, ER+/HER2− disease after prior endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, would a PARP inhibitor be an evidence‑based systemic option in the metastatic setting for a germline BRCA2 carrier, and which agents and supporting trials inform that recommendation?

### Answer 4

Yes. In the metastatic setting, PARP inhibitors are approved and evidence‑based for BRCA1/2 germline‑mutated, HER2‑negative metastatic breast cancer. Olaparib (OlympiAD trial) and talazoparib (EMBRACA trial) showed improved progression‑free survival versus physician’s choice chemotherapy in gBRCA‑mutant metastatic breast cancer and are approved options. Platinum chemotherapy is also often active in BRCA‑associated disease.

---

## Q5 (010_5)

Given the pathology report describing a narrow posterior margin (<1 mm) on the mastectomy specimen and that the patient received chest‑wall radiotherapy, what is the contemporary oncologic significance of a close margin after mastectomy and how should this influence local management and surveillance in this patient?

### Answer 5

After mastectomy, close margins are less strongly associated with local recurrence than after breast‑conserving surgery. Chest‑wall radiotherapy is indicated for certain high‑risk features (such as node‑positive disease and high‑grade tumors) and addresses close posterior margins; no routine re‑excision is typically required when RT is planned and margins are not overtly positive. Surveillance should include clinical exams and imaging as clinically indicated.

---

## Q6 (010_6)

What additional genomic testing (tumor and germline) would you recommend today to inform recurrence risk stratification, trial eligibility, and systemic therapy selection, and why? Include specific biomarkers and technical details that matter (e.g., TMB, MSI, somatic NGS including VAF/read depth when relevant).

### Answer 6

Recommend multigene germline panel testing (if not already done) to detect additional actionable predisposition variants (PALB2, CHEK2, TP53, ATM). Perform comprehensive somatic tumor NGS to identify targetable alterations (PIK3CA, ESR1, AKT1, NTRK), determine TMB and MSI status, and assess copy‑number alterations and LOH for BRCA2. Report VAF and read depth for somatic variants and perform paired germline testing to distinguish somatic vs germline findings. Tumor LOH/biallelic loss assessment for BRCA2 can inform PARP sensitivity.

---

## Q7 (010_7)

If a somatic BRCA2 truncating variant were found (VAF 35%, read depth 800×) but germline testing were negative, how would this alter trial eligibility or therapeutic options compared with the current germline BRCA2 pathogenic variant? Discuss PARP inhibitor access and evidence for benefit in somatic BRCA alterations.

### Answer 7

A pathogenic somatic BRCA2 truncation at VAF ~35% (high read depth) is likely clinically significant; somatic BRCA alterations can confer PARP inhibitor sensitivity in the metastatic setting and permit trial eligibility, but the OlympiA adjuvant label specifically requires germline BRCA. Confirm germline negativity, assess LOH/biallelic loss; in metastatic disease PARP inhibitors are still an evidence‑based option for somatic BRCA alterations in many contexts and clinical trials.

## Q8 (010_8)

Outline a cascade testing and surveillance plan for first‑degree relatives (sister and two children aged 17 and 13), including timing, counseling, and practical considerations.

### Answer 8

Offer targeted testing for the known familial BRCA2 6174delT variant to adult first‑degree relatives (sister) with pre‑test genetic counseling. Defer predictive testing of minors for adult‑onset conditions until adulthood unless a clear childhood intervention is indicated; offer age‑appropriate counseling to children and plan for testing at ≥18 years. If relatives test positive, enroll them in high‑risk surveillance (breast MRI/clinical breast exam, prostate screening for men starting ~age 45, pancreatic screening if family history) and discuss risk‑reducing strategies. Use genetic counseling resources, document GINA protections, and coordinate with primary care for surveillance logistics.

---

## Q9 (010_9)

Provide two appropriate trial‑matching rationales (specific trial classes/targets) for this patient if he developed early systemic relapse after adjuvant therapy and describe the eligibility features that would support enrollment.

### Answer 9

1) PARP inhibitor combination trials (eg, PARP inhibitor + immune checkpoint inhibitor or PARP inhibitor + targeted agent) given germline BRCA2 positivity; eligibility often requires gBRCA or tumor BRCA and prior therapies with adequate organ function. 2) PI3K/AKT/mTOR or novel endocrine‑targeting trials for ER+ disease (eg, PI3K inhibitor for PIK3CA‑mutant tumors or SERD/CDK4/6 next‑generation combinations) requiring somatic alteration on tumor testing. Trial matching needs up‑to‑date somatic/germline results and adequate performance status.

---

## Q10 (010_10)

Based on the patient’s baseline LFTs (AST/ALT 46 U/L, total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL), what monitoring, dose adjustments, or contraindications should be considered before prescribing olaparib, and what baseline surveillance should be performed?

### Answer 10

Mild transaminase elevations and bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL are generally acceptable for initiation but require baseline and periodic monitoring. Olaparib dosing requires caution in moderate‑to‑severe hepatic impairment; consult label for exact dose adjustments. Baseline CBC, LFTs, and renal function are required; monitor CBC frequently (eg, monthly initially) for cytopenias and monitor for signs of MDS/AML. If hepatic impairment progresses, follow label‑specified dose modifications or hold therapy.
