# Case vignette: Advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (FIGO IIIC) with long-standing idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)

## Demographics and relevant history
- Age / sex: 55-year-old woman
- Obstetric history: gravida 2, para 1
- Relevant past medical history: 20-year history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) with chronic thrombocytopenia (baseline platelet counts ~20–30 ×10^9/L). No prior treatment of ITP documented until cancer diagnosis period.
- Performance status / organ function: Performance status not explicitly reported in the source manuscript. No baseline hepatic or renal dysfunction was reported. Hematologic organ-function abnormalities were limited to chronic thrombocytopenia; transient severe cytopenias related to chemotherapy were documented (see below).

## Presentation and timeline
- Presentation: Incidental detection of a lower abdominal mass on routine exam; no abdominal distension or ascites on exam or ultrasound.
- Baseline tumor markers: CA125 = 366 U/mL (elevated); CA19-9 11.3 U/mL (normal); CEA 3.6 ng/mL (normal).
- Diagnostic workup prior to surgery:
  - Ultrasound-guided needle biopsy: high-grade serous carcinoma; IHC positive for CK7 and PAX8.
  - MRI pelvis: two lesions – left pelvic mass 3.6 × 3.1 cm (omentum metastasis from ovary) and a 2.0 × 1.7 cm lesion adjacent to right pelvic wall (enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node). Both lesions T2 hyperintense and DWI hyperintense consistent with high-grade malignancy.
  - PET/CT: FDG-avid pelvic mass (left lesion SUVmax 8.3) and multiple pelvic lymph nodes (largest SUVmax 7.6).
- FIGO stage and operative findings: Stage IIIC (high-grade serous carcinoma) with metastatic omental tumor and enlarged right obturator and common iliac nodes; peritoneal carcinomatosis index = 3. Complete macroscopic resection achieved (CC0) with omentectomy, total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy.

## Perioperative hematologic management
- Preoperative therapy to raise platelets: IVIG and recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) for 5 days → platelet increase to 145 ×10^9/L, but decline to 42 ×10^9/L by day 9 post-treatment. Pre-op eltrombopag 50 mg daily plus platelet transfusion (1 unit) raised platelets to 73 ×10^9/L on operative day. One additional intraoperative platelet unit transfused.
- Postoperative course: Platelet count rose transiently to 107 ×10^9/L after surgery.

## Adjuvant systemic therapy attempt and toxicity
- Chemotherapy regimen (dose-modified): Paclitaxel 135 mg/m^2 and carboplatin AUC = 4, initiated postoperative day 21.
- Toxicity and discontinuation: By day 8 platelets fell to 32 ×10^9/L, nadir 8 ×10^9/L on day 13 with mucocutaneous bleeding (lower limb and conjunctival). Concurrent grade 3 leukopenia and grade 4 granulocytopenia. Chemotherapy discontinued due to life-threatening hematologic toxicity despite supportive measures (rhTPO for 14 days and escalated eltrombopag dose restored platelets to 114 ×10^9/L).

## Molecular/genomic results and biomarkers
- Genomic testing: Germline BRCA1 pathogenic mutation reported. The report does NOT provide variant allele fraction (VAF), read depth, or copy-number details. No MSI or TMB data reported. PD-L1 / FISH / other tumor biomarker testing beyond CK7/PAX8 IHC were not reported.

## Subsequent management and maintenance therapy
- Decision: Given platinum-chemo intolerance and detection of germline BRCA1 mutation, patient was started on olaparib 300 mg twice daily (Lynparza) as monotherapy maintenance.
- Hematologic co-management: Eltrombopag dose titrated (documented 50–75 mg once daily), mycophenolate mofetil (0.5–0.75 g twice daily) added for ITP, and ongoing hematology follow-up.
- Dose adjustments: Over long-term follow-up, olaparib dose was reduced to 150 mg twice daily based on platelet counts and tolerability.

## Surveillance and outcomes
- Duration of follow-up: 48 months after starting olaparib maintenance.
- Disease status: Sustained complete radiologic remission (imaging negative), CA125 normalized and remained within normal range throughout follow-up.
- Hematologic status: Platelet counts stabilized at ~40–60 ×10^9/L on combined regimen (olaparib 150 mg bid, eltrombopag 50–75 mg qd, mycophenolate mofetil 0.5–0.75 g bid). No recurrent severe bleeding events reported after therapy adjustments.

## Key clinical points and limitations of report
- This case documents successful long-term (4-year) remission with PARP inhibitor monotherapy after complete cytoreductive surgery in a chemotherapy-intolerant patient with germline BRCA1-mutated high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and chronic ITP.
- Important missing genomic details: VAF, sequencing read-depth, somatic vs germline confirmation beyond the statement of germline BRCA1, copy-number alterations, MSI and TMB were not reported.
- Performance status and formal organ-function metrics (creatinine, bilirubin, LFTs) were not explicitly provided in the manuscript and should be ascertained in clinical practice.

## Q1 (034_1)

In a 55-year-old woman with germline BRCA1-mutated, FIGO IIIC high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma who underwent complete macroscopic resection (CC0) but could not complete adjuvant platinum-taxane chemotherapy because of life-threatening cytopenias from chronic ITP, is initiating olaparib monotherapy as first-line maintenance supported by high-level evidence and guideline recommendations for newly diagnosed BRCA-mutant advanced ovarian cancer?

### Answer 1

SOLO1 (SOLO1/GOG-3004) randomized evidence and NCCN guidance support olaparib maintenance after a response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in BRCA-mutant advanced ovarian cancer. Those randomized data assume prior platinum therapy; initiating olaparib without prior platinum exposure is not the guideline-standard pathway. In exceptional cases where chemotherapy is contraindicated and a germline BRCA1 mutation is present, olaparib monotherapy can be an individualized approach with biologic rationale (BRCA1 deficiency predicts PARP sensitivity), but evidence level is low (case report/observational). Multidisciplinary discussion and informed consent are required.

## Q2 (034_2)

What is the expected hematologic toxicity profile of olaparib in a patient with chronic ITP and prior severe chemo-induced cytopenias, and what monitoring strategy should be used to minimize risk of serious myelosuppression (including MDS/AML)?

### Answer 2

Olaparib commonly causes anemia; thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occur less frequently and grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia is uncommon (~1%). PARP inhibitors carry a low but recognized risk of MDS/AML. In this patient with compromised marrow reserve, enhanced monitoring is required: baseline CBC with differential and peripheral smear; CBC weekly to biweekly initially (first 4–8 weeks) then at least monthly if stable; prompt bone marrow evaluation for persistent or progressive cytopenias. Follow Lynparza label dose‑modification rules for hematologic toxicity and consult hematology for suspected MDS/AML.

---

## Q3 (034_3)

Given the patient’s chronic baseline platelet counts (~20–30 ×10^9/L) that stabilized to ~40–60 ×10^9/L on eltrombopag, what starting olaparib dose and CBC monitoring cadence are reasonable, and what specific thresholds should prompt olaparib dose reduction, interruption, or discontinuation in this patient?

### Answer 3

Labeled starting dose is olaparib 300 mg PO twice daily. In patients with chronic thrombocytopenia clinicians may reasonably start at a reduced dose (e.g., 150 mg PO twice daily) or start at full dose with very close CBC monitoring if platelets ≥50 ×10^9/L. For platelets <50 ×10^9/L or active bleeding, consider reduced starting dose and coordinate with hematology and TPO-RA support (eltrombopag). Dose interruption/reduction/discontinuation should follow Lynparza label recommendations for hematologic toxicity (interrupt for Grade ≥3 cytopenias or persistent Grade 2 cytopenias with bleeding) and escalate to bone marrow evaluation if cytopenias are prolonged.

---

## Q4 (034_4)

Are there clinically important pharmacologic interactions, overlapping toxicities, or safety concerns when co-administering eltrombopag (a TPO-RA) and olaparib in this patient, and how should the team mitigate them?

### Answer 4

No strong pharmacokinetic interaction is established between eltrombopag and olaparib. Overlapping safety concerns include increased thrombotic risk with eltrombopag and reported thromboembolic events in oncology patients; both agents have hepatic safety considerations (eltrombopag hepatotoxicity; olaparib metabolic considerations). Mitigation: use the lowest effective eltrombopag dose to maintain safe platelets, monitor LFTs periodically, monitor for thrombotic signs, and manage jointly with hematology. Periodic CBC and LFT monitoring per labels is indicated.

## Q5 (034_5)

If the patient experiences radiographic progression while on olaparib monotherapy, what are the evidence-based next therapeutic options that should be considered given (a) germline BRCA1, (b) prior intolerance to platinum (life-threatening thrombocytopenia), and (c) current performance and organ function presumed preserved?

### Answer 5

Consider (1) reassessment for possible platinum rechallenge if marrow reserve can be improved and bleeding risk mitigated; (2) non-platinum cytotoxic options with hematologic precautions (e.g., pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, weekly paclitaxel, topotecan) though these carry marrow suppression risk; (3) clinical trials (PARP combinations, ATR/WEE1 inhibitors, novel ADCs); (4) biomarker-directed agents if applicable (e.g., mirvetuximab for FRα-positive disease). Given prior platinum intolerance, re-challenge should be multidisciplinary and only after marrow recovery; clinical trial enrollment is strongly recommended.

## Q6 (034_6)

The case report states a germline BRCA1 mutation but does not provide VAF or read depth. For precision decision-making (e.g., predicting depth/durability of PARP inhibitor response and potential tumor heterogeneity), what additional genomic information should be requested, and how would VAF/LOH data influence management?

### Answer 6

Request: (a) exact germline variant nomenclature and confirmatory germline report; (b) tumor NGS including somatic BRCA1 status, VAF, read depth, loss of heterozygosity (LOH)/biallelic status, and HRD/genomic instability score if available. Biallelic inactivation or LOH supports stronger PARP inhibitor sensitivity and predicts longer benefit. Low tumor VAF or absence of LOH may temper expectations for durable response. These metrics may affect trial eligibility and prognostication.

## Q7 (034_7)

From a guideline and risk perspective, what are the implications of omitting standard adjuvant platinum-taxane chemotherapy in a patient with resected FIGO IIIC high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, and how should surveillance and follow-up be modified if chemotherapy is not given?

### Answer 7

Standard of care is adjuvant platinum-taxane chemotherapy after cytoreductive surgery for FIGO IIIC high-grade serous carcinoma. Omitting chemotherapy likely increases recurrence risk compared with standard care. If chemotherapy is omitted for safety, adopt intensified surveillance: more frequent clinical visits, CA125 monitoring every 1–3 months initially, and imaging guided by symptoms or marker changes. Document individualized multidisciplinary rationale and obtain informed consent.

## Q8 (034_8)

What is the recommended duration of olaparib maintenance in the first-line BRCA-mutant setting according to SOLO1 and the drug label, and how does that align with the 48-month duration reported in this case?

### Answer 8

SOLO1 evaluated up to 2 years of olaparib maintenance (with long-term follow-up reporting sustained benefit). The Lynparza label supports first-line maintenance in BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer; in practice some patients continue beyond 2 years for perceived benefit and tolerability, but randomized data for extended durations are limited. The 48-month continuous therapy in this case exceeds the originally studied 2-year maintenance period and represents extended/individualized therapy with supportive long-term follow-up data from extensions.

---

## Q9 (034_9)

Does the combination of chronic immunosuppression for ITP (mycophenolate mofetil) and long-term PARP inhibitor therapy alter infectious risk, vaccination recommendations, or surveillance strategies for this patient?

### Answer 9

Mycophenolate increases infection risk and can blunt vaccine responses; olaparib may cause neutropenia. Combined therapy increases infection risk if neutropenia occurs. Recommendations: ensure up-to-date inactivated vaccinations (annual influenza, COVID vaccinations per local guidance), avoid live vaccines while immunosuppressed, monitor CBC regularly, counsel on infection signs, and consider infectious disease/primary care involvement for prophylaxis if prolonged neutropenia or other risk factors develop.

---

## Q10 (034_10)

What family-level genetic counseling and cascade testing steps are recommended for a patient with a reported germline BRCA1 pathogenic variant, and how do these recommendations affect the patient’s long-term cancer risk management beyond ovarian cancer?

### Answer 10

Confirm the exact germline BRCA1 variant and provide genetic counseling. Offer cascade testing to at‑risk relatives. For the patient, discuss breast cancer risk management (enhanced surveillance with annual MRI and mammography, consideration of risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy), document the performed bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (if applicable), and counsel regarding pancreatic and other BRCA1-associated cancer risks as per guidelines. Referral to a certified genetic counselor is standard.
