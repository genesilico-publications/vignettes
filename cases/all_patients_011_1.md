# Case 22-2020: A 62-Year-Old Woman with Early Breast Cancer during the Covid-19 Pandemic — Case Vignette

## Brief summary
- Patient: 62-year-old woman of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.
- Presentation: Self-detected left-breast mass during the Covid-19 pandemic; confirmed on physical exam.
- Medical history: Asthma; remote excisional biopsy of a left breast fibroadenoma (30 years earlier). No known family history of breast or ovarian cancer reported. Menarche at 12 years; menopause at 54 years; no hormone-replacement therapy.
- Performance status: Not explicitly stated; clinical note: "currently doing well" while on neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (suggests ambulatory, likely ECOG 0–1).

## Clinical presentation and timeline
- Initial detection: Patient noted a palpable mass in the left breast and was evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Imaging: Bilateral diagnostic mammography and targeted ultrasound (last prior mammogram 7 years earlier).
  - Mammography: Irregular spiculated mass underlying skin marker in the left breast (~3 cm) with features highly suggestive of malignancy.
  - Ultrasound: Solid, hypoechoic, irregular mass measuring ~3.1 × 1.5 × 1.2 cm with angular margins and posterior acoustic shadowing; left axillary nodes sonographically normal.
- Tissue diagnosis: Ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy (14-gauge) performed.

## Pathology and biomarker results (core-needle biopsy)
- Histology: Invasive ductal carcinoma with nests and cords of malignant cells, pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and desmoplastic stroma.
- Grade: Grade 2.
- Hormone receptors: Strong, diffuse ER nuclear positivity (>90%) and strong PR positivity by IHC.
- HER2: IHC equivocal; FISH showed no amplification (HER2-negative by amplification testing).

## Genomic/molecular data
- 21-gene recurrence score (Oncotype DX): Recurrence score = 24 (intermediate category).
- No tumor NGS panel data (no somatic mutation VAF/read-depth, copy-number, MSI, TMB reported).

## Clinical staging
- Clinical T stage: cT2 (tumor ≈3.0–3.1 cm)
- Clinical nodal status: cN0 (no palpable or sonographic axillary disease)
- Clinical prognostic stage: IB (T2N0, HR+, HER2−) per the report.

## Initial management and course during the COVID-19 pandemic
- Multidisciplinary team concluded upfront surgery was not feasible because of local Covid-19 restrictions; nonessential elective invasive procedures suspended.
- Management: Initiation of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor (AI). Planned clinical follow-up at ~2 months after starting AI.
- Rationale: Neoadjuvant AI reduces need for urgent surgery while limiting immunosuppression and hospital exposure. It can downstage tumor to permit breast-conserving surgery and allows genomic results (Oncotype DX) to inform adjuvant therapy.

## Prior treatments, responses, and toxicities
- No prior systemic therapy for this cancer prior to AI. Remote excision of fibroadenoma >30 years ago.

## Current issues to be addressed for treatment planning
- Appropriateness and duration of continued neoadjuvant AI given intermediate Oncotype DX score (24) in a postmenopausal woman.
- Monitoring strategy during neoadjuvant AI (clinical exam, imaging if indicated, on-treatment Ki-67 assessment) and thresholds for switching to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
- Whether to perform germline BRCA testing given Ashkenazi ancestry.
- Radiation planning and timing if/when breast-conserving surgery occurs during the pandemic.

## Missing / pertinent negatives
- Ki-67 proliferation index not reported on the core biopsy.
- No germline testing reported.
- No baseline labs or organ-function tests provided in the case text.

## Key clinical summary (precision-oncology emphasis)
- Diagnosis: ER+/PR+/HER2− invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2, clinical T2N0 in a 62-year-old postmenopausal woman.
- Tumor genomics: Oncotype DX recurrence score 24 (intermediate).
- Initial pandemic-modified management: Neoadjuvant aromatase-inhibitor therapy; close follow-up recommended; consider on-treatment Ki-67 assessment at 2–4 weeks to evaluate endocrine sensitivity.

## Q1 (011_1)

Based on this patient’s age (62 years), tumor biology (ER+/PR+, HER2−), clinical stage (cT2N0), and an Oncotype DX recurrence score of 24, would you routinely recommend adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy after definitive local therapy? Explain your reasoning and cite the highest-level evidence informing this decision.

### Answer 1

No — for a postmenopausal (>50 y) woman with ER+/HER2−, node-negative disease and an Oncotype DX recurrence score in the midrange (11–25; here 24), TAILORx randomized data indicate no added benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy over endocrine therapy alone. Therefore routine adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy is not recommended unless additional high-risk clinical/pathologic features are present.

---

## Q2 (011_2)

Given the local suspension of elective surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic, justify the choice of neoadjuvant aromatase-inhibitor therapy for this patient and state the expected time frame and clinical criteria for continuing neoadjuvant endocrine therapy versus proceeding to surgery.

### Answer 2

Neoadjuvant AI is appropriate: in postmenopausal ER+ patients, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (typically 3–6 months, extendable if responding) can safely defer surgery, reduce exposure and resource use, and improve breast-conservation rates. Continue if there is clinical response or stable disease; prioritize surgery if there is progression or lack of adequate response after an appropriate period and resource availability permits.

---

## Q3 (011_3)

While the patient receives neoadjuvant aromatase-inhibitor therapy, what specific on-treatment biomarker and threshold would you use to decide whether to switch to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and at what time point should this be measured? Provide supporting trial evidence and explain how this threshold applies to this patient’s Oncotype DX score.

### Answer 3

Measure Ki-67 on a repeat tumor biopsy at ~2–4 weeks after starting AI. A Ki-67 >10% on the on-treatment biopsy (per ACOSOG Z1031/Z1031B protocol) is the commonly used threshold to consider switching to neoadjuvant chemotherapy because persistent high proliferation predicts endocrine resistance. This applies regardless of an intermediate RS (24); TransNEOS showed RS ≥31 predicts higher progression risk on neo-ET, but on-treatment Ki-67 is a proximate functional assay of sensitivity.

---

## Q4 (011_4)

If the patient’s tumor demonstrates radiographic or clinical progression while on neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, what is the recommended next-line management in the neoadjuvant setting, and how should resource constraints during a pandemic modify your approach?

### Answer 4

If progression occurs, prioritize definitive surgery when feasible (high priority). If surgery must still be deferred and the patient is a candidate, switch to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (anthracycline/taxane-based) with consideration of less immunosuppressive alternatives and G-CSF prophylaxis during a pandemic. Resource constraints might necessitate triaging to earlier surgery or selecting regimens with lower clinic visit frequency and careful use of growth-factor support.

## Q5 (011_5)

Should this patient undergo germline BRCA1/2 testing given her Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry and lack of a reported family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and how would a positive germline BRCA1/2 result alter adjuvant systemic therapy options in 2021–2024 (specify relevant trials/approvals)?

### Answer 5

Yes — germline BRCA testing is recommended or strongly considered for individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry because of higher prevalence of founder variants, even with no family history. If a pathogenic germline BRCA1/2 variant is found and the patient meets high-risk criteria (e.g., node-positive or otherwise high-risk and/or receipt of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy depending on OlympiA criteria), adjuvant olaparib for 1 year after (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy is an evidence-based option per OlympiA. Germline results also guide surgical risk-reduction counseling and family testing.

## Q6 (011_6)

Is this patient eligible for adjuvant abemaciclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) in combination with endocrine therapy based on current published criteria from the monarchE trial? Explain why or why not, citing eligibility criteria relevant to this patient.

### Answer 6

No — monarchE enrolled patients with HR+, HER2− early breast cancer who were node-positive and had high-risk features (e.g., ≥4 positive nodes or 1–3 nodes plus additional high-risk features such as grade 3, tumor size ≥5 cm, or elevated Ki-67 depending on cohort). This patient is node-negative (cN0) and therefore would not meet primary monarchE enrollment criteria for adjuvant abemaciclib.

## Q7 (011_7)

How should radiation therapy be sequenced and timed after breast-conserving surgery in this patient if surgery is performed during the pandemic, and what hypofractionation approaches are reasonable to minimize exposure while maintaining oncologic outcomes?

### Answer 7

Radiation may be delayed up to ~20 weeks after lumpectomy if no chemotherapy is given (pandemic guidance). Hypofractionated whole-breast radiation (3–4 weeks) is preferred over conventional schedules; ultrahypofractionation (FAST-Forward, 5 fractions) is an option for select patients to minimize visits. Accelerated partial-breast irradiation may be considered for appropriately selected low-risk patients. Decisions should reflect multidisciplinary input and patient-specific recurrence risk.

---

## Q8 (011_8)

If the 21-gene recurrence score had been ≥31 instead of 24, how would that influence (a) the risk of progression on neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and (b) your initial treatment recommendation during the pandemic? Cite the relevant study supporting this change.

### Answer 8

(a) RS ≥31 is associated with higher risk of progression on neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (TransNEOS reported progression ~17% for RS ≥31 vs much lower for RS <31). (b) With RS ≥31, lower threshold to recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy or prioritize surgery: neoadjuvant endocrine therapy would be less favored because of increased endocrine resistance risk.

---

## Q9 (011_9)

List and justify the baseline clinical and laboratory assessments (including any tumor biomarker or molecular tests) you would obtain before continuing neoadjuvant therapy or proceeding to surgery in this patient, explaining how each impacts treatment selection and safety.

### Answer 9

Baseline assessments: ECOG performance status and focused breast/nodal exam (clinical monitoring); baseline bilateral imaging and possibly MRI if discrepancy; baseline labs (CBC with differential, CMP including hepatic and renal function) to assess chemo safety if needed; bone density considerations prior to long-term AI therapy; pathology confirmation of ER/PR/HER2 (done) and baseline Ki-67 to compare to on-treatment value; germline BRCA1/2 testing given Ashkenazi ancestry. These inform risk stratification, identify candidates for alternate/adjunct therapies, and ensure organ-function safety for chemotherapy if escalation required.

---

## Q10 (011_10)

Discuss clinical trial opportunities or precision-medicine considerations that would be appropriate to present to this patient now or in the near term, explicitly tying trial eligibility to her clinicopathologic parameters (age, node-negative status, ER+/HER2− biology, recurrence score 24, Ashkenazi ancestry).

### Answer 10

Appropriate trial/precision options: (1) Neoadjuvant endocrine-adaptive trials using early Ki-67 or genomic markers to decide escalation to chemo — appropriate because she is ER+/HER2− and postmenopausal; (2) Germline-testing–linked research or founder-panel screening programs appropriate to Ashkenazi ancestry; (3) If gBRCA+ and if she meets OlympiA high-risk criteria post-(neo)adjuvant chemo, adjuvant olaparib would be an evidence-based option; (4) For later recurrence, tumor NGS for actionable alterations (PIK3CA, ESR1) to inform targeted therapy trials. Presenting these options aligns trial eligibility with her node-negative ER+/HER2− status and genomic profile.
