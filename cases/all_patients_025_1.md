# Case vignette: Exploiting somatic oncogenic driver alterations in a patient with Li‑Fraumeni syndrome

## Demographics and relevant history
- Female patient; non-smoker.
- Key ages/events:
  - Age 44: Premenopausal ER‑positive left breast cancer (pT1c pN1b M0, G2) — lumpectomy with axillary dissection; adjuvant chemotherapy with 4 cycles epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC), 3 cycles CMF, and radiotherapy (60 Gy).
  - Age 48: Hormone‑receptor negative, HER2‑positive DCIS of the right breast — lumpectomy followed by risk‑reducing unilateral mastectomy.
  - Age 53: Triple‑negative breast cancer left breast (pT1c pN0 M0, G3) — mastectomy and 6 cycles docetaxel; achieved durable remission (>10 years).
  - Age 62: High‑grade osteoblastic osteosarcoma of right frontal skullcap; resection with uncertain margins (Rx), early locoregional recurrence with orbital infiltration on 18F‑FDG PET/MRI.
  - Age 63: Molecular profiling of osteosarcoma guided targeted therapy (palbociclib) after chemotherapy discontinued for severe ifosfamide neurotoxicity (CTCAE grade 4).
  - Age 64: High‑grade serous ovarian carcinoma (FIGO stage II) with peritoneal seeding; bilateral salpingo‑oophorectomy with staging; carboplatin monotherapy (de‑escalated due to severe kidney toxicity) and later olaparib maintenance.

## Constitutional/genetic diagnosis
- Germline TP53 pathogenic nonsense variant: NM_000546.6 (reported as NM_001126114.2:c.499 C>T), p.(Gln167*) — classified pathogenic (class 5) → diagnosis consistent with Li‑Fraumeni syndrome (LFS).
- Additional germline findings: CHEK2 c.684‑4 C>G (VUS, class 3) and GPRC5A c.183delG (VUS, class 3).
- Family history unremarkable; likely de novo germline TP53 variant suspected.

## Osteosarcoma (right frontal skullcap) — clinical course
- Presentation: high‑grade osteoblastic osteosarcoma; resection by micro‑neurosurgery; margins uncertain (Rx).
- Imaging: correlative MRI and CT confirmed osteoblastic skull lesion with local erosion; early postoperative 18F‑FDG PET/MRI showed two FDG‑avid loci at resection margins and orbital infiltration consistent with local recurrence.
- Systemic therapy: Euro‑B.O.S.S. chemotherapy was initiated but stopped after 3 cycles because of severe ifosfamide‑induced neurotoxicity (CTCAE grade 4).
- Persistent FDG uptake prompted comprehensive molecular profiling (targeted NGS and OncoScan CNV) from FFPE osteosarcoma tissue.

## Osteosarcoma — molecular / genomic findings (tumor content ~90%)
- Somatic detection of the constitutional TP53 variant in tumor with VAF 83.6% (tumor content 90%) → indicates loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at TP53.
- OncoScan CNV: homozygous loss at 9p21.3 encompassing CDKN2A (threshold log2 ratio ±0.3, 5 Mb cutoff).
- Targeted NGS (selected somatic variants and VAFs):
  - TP53 c.499 C>T p.(Gln167*) — VAF 83.60% (class 5; constitutional).
  - NF2 c.99+1 G>C (splice) — VAF 55.60% (class 5).
  - NF2 c.634 C>T p.(Gln212*) — VAF 9.87% (class 5).
  - FBXW7 c.661 C>T p.(Gln221*) — VAF 9.44% (class 5).
  - BTK c.364 G>A p.(Glu122Lys) — VAF 9.44% (likely pathogenic, class 4).
- Interpretation: Complex karyotype with multiple deleterious somatic events; actionable homozygous CDKN2A loss suggested CDK4/6 inhibition as an off‑label biologic strategy.

## Osteosarcoma — targeted therapy and response
- Off‑label palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) was initiated as maintenance therapy based on CDKN2A homozygous loss.
- Palbociclib dosing used: 21 days on / 7 days off per 28‑day cycle (standard palbociclib schedule); tolerability: grade 1 weakness and hematologic toxicity; therapy continued for 22 months.
- Outcome: Complete metabolic response on 18F‑FDG PET/MRI after 22 months; therapy discontinued after one year of CR (22 months total on drug) with no evidence of disease at last follow‑up (CR for 27 months from timeline figure until subsequent ovarian cancer event).

## Ovarian carcinoma — clinical course and molecular findings (tumor content ~30%)
- Presentation: Progressive back pain; PET‑MRI revealed suspicious right ovarian lesion; surgery (bilateral salpingo‑oophorectomy, hysterectomy, appendectomy, pelvic deperitonealization) confirmed high‑grade serous ovarian carcinoma FIGO stage II with peritoneal seeding.
- Chemotherapy: Carboplatin/paclitaxel planned but de‑escalated to carboplatin monotherapy due to severe kidney toxicity.
- Molecular findings (OncoScan CNV and targeted NGS):
  - TP53 c.499 C>T p.(Gln167*) in tumor — VAF 73.24% (tumor content 30%) → LOH of TP53 in ovarian tumor.
  - OncoScan: interstitial heterozygous loss at 13q12.3 (BRCA2 locus) detected; heterozygous loss of TP53 (17p13) and CHEK2 (22q12) also noted.
  - Targeted sequencing: ATR frameshift/deletion (NM_001184.4:c.3820‑24_3856del; VAF 9.84%, likely pathogenic class 4), and EPHB1 c.2689 G>A p.(Val897Met) VAF 50.04% (likely pathogenic class 4).
- Therapeutic decision: Given interstitial BRCA2 loss, olaparib (PARP inhibitor) was initiated 8 months post‑diagnosis.
- Outcome: At 6‑month FDG‑PET/MRI follow‑up, no residual tumor identified; ongoing complete remission noted at the time of the report.

## Performance status and organ function
- Performance status not quantified by ECOG in the report; patient tolerated prolonged palbociclib with only grade 1 weakness and hematologic toxicity reported.
- Renal toxicity during chemotherapy for ovarian cancer necessitated carboplatin monotherapy (indicating impaired renal tolerance during platinum combination at that time).

## Prior treatments and toxicities summary
- Multiple prior breast cancer surgeries and systemic therapies including anthracycline (epirubicin), alkylating (cyclophosphamide), CMF, taxane (docetaxel), and prior radiotherapy (60 Gy) during earlier breast cancer care.
- Severe ifosfamide‑induced neurotoxicity (CTCAE grade 4) during Euro‑B.O.S.S. contributed to discontinuation of chemotherapy for osteosarcoma.
- Severe kidney toxicity during ovarian cancer chemotherapy led to de‑escalation from carboplatin/paclitaxel to carboplatin alone.

## Key clinical considerations for precision oncology in this patient
- Germline TP53 pathogenic variant with somatic LOH in multiple tumors → Li‑Fraumeni syndrome and high risk for treatment‑related second malignancies; avoidance of genotoxic therapy where possible is recommended.
- Exploitation of somatic co‑alterations (homozygous CDKN2A loss in osteosarcoma; BRCA2 interstitial loss in ovarian carcinoma) enabled targeted, less‑genotoxic approaches (palbociclib and olaparib) with documented clinical responses.
- Multidisciplinary molecular tumor board (MoFa MTB) guided individualized off‑label targeted therapy decisions with multidisciplinary risk–benefit evaluation.

## Summary statement
This case exemplifies precision oncology in LFS by integrating constitutional and somatic molecular profiling to select targeted therapies (palbociclib for CDKN2A homozygous loss in osteosarcoma; olaparib for BRCA2 loss in ovarian carcinoma), achieving durable complete metabolic responses while minimizing further genotoxic exposure.

## Q1 (025_1)

Given the osteosarcoma specimen showing homozygous loss of CDKN2A (9p21.3) and TP53 LOH (TP53 VAF 83.6% in tumor with 90% tumor content), critically evaluate the biological rationale and clinical appropriateness of using palbociclib (a CDK4/6 inhibitor) as maintenance therapy in this patient, and state the standard starting dose and monitoring parameters you would use.

### Answer 1

Biological rationale: CDKN2A encodes p16INK4a, an endogenous inhibitor of CDK4/6; homozygous deletion of CDKN2A releases CDK4/6 from p16‑mediated restraint, rendering tumor cells more dependent on CDK4/6 activity and therefore potentially sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition. TP53 LOH increases genomic instability but does not preclude CDK4/6 inhibition; it may influence checkpoint responses and sensitivity. Clinical evidence: activity of palbociclib has been documented in selected sarcoma contexts and translational models in tumors with CDKN2A loss, but randomized data are lacking in osteosarcoma, so use is off‑label and MTB‑guided. Standard dosing and monitoring: palbociclib 125 mg orally once daily, 21 days on/7 days off per 28‑day cycle; monitor CBC for neutropenia prior to each cycle and during early cycles; monitor for fatigue, infection, and pulmonary symptoms (ILD/pneumonitis). Dose modifications per label for grade ≥3 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia. In this patient, palbociclib was a reasonable MTB‑directed off‑label strategy and the patient achieved durable metabolic CR.

## Q2 (025_2)

The ovarian carcinoma shows an interstitial heterozygous loss at the BRCA2 locus on OncoScan (13q12.3) and tumor TP53 VAF 73.24% with tumor content ≈30%. Explain whether olaparib is molecularly justified in this patient, what additional molecular evidence would strengthen the indication, and how VAF and tumor content influence interpretation.

### Answer 2

PARP inhibitors are effective in tumors with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), often due to biallelic BRCA1/2 inactivation. A single‑copy (heterozygous) BRCA2 loss suggests one allele deleted; effective PARP sensitivity generally requires biallelic loss (pathogenic mutation + LOH or homozygous deletion). Additional evidence that strengthens indication: demonstration of biallelic BRCA2 inactivation (pathogenic BRCA2 mutation with LOH or second hit), genomic HRD signature (LOH score, LSTs, mutational signature 3), or functional HRD assays. VAF/tumor content influence: low tumor purity dilutes expected VAFs; an observed high TP53 VAF (73.24%) in a 30% tumor implies LOH. Read depth and allele‑specific CN details increase confidence. Given the reported BRCA2 interstitial loss, MTB decision to use olaparib is justifiable, particularly when combined with supportive HRD/clinical response data.

## Q3 (025_3)

For a patient with germline pathogenic TP53 (p.(Gln167*)) and prior radiotherapy exposure, summarize guideline‑based considerations for the future use of radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy, and propose alternative systemic strategies grounded in the patient’s molecular profile.

### Answer 3

Germline TP53 pathogenic variants (LFS) confer increased risk of radiotherapy‑ and chemotherapy‑related secondary malignancies; guidelines recommend minimizing ionizing radiation when feasible and favoring non‑genotoxic options. Surveillance per Toronto Protocol (whole‑body MRI) is recommended. Alternative systemic strategies include targeted agents guided by somatic actionable alterations (e.g., CDK4/6 inhibitor for CDKN2A homozygous loss; PARP inhibitor for BRCA‑deficient tumors), and clinical trial enrollment of non‑genotoxic targeted or combination approaches. If genotoxic therapy is necessary, individualize with detailed risk–benefit discussions and enhanced surveillance.

---

## Q4 (025_4)

Interpret the TP53 VAFs reported in the osteosarcoma (83.6% VAF; tumor content 90%) and ovarian carcinoma (73.24% VAF; tumor content ~30%). Demonstrate the calculation/logic that supports LOH in each tumor and note any caveats due to missing assay metrics.

### Answer 4

Expected VAF for a heterozygous somatic variant ≈ tumor_fraction × 0.5 if present in all tumor cells. Osteosarcoma: tumor_fraction 0.9 → expected heterozygous VAF ≈45%; observed 83.6% indicates loss of the wild‑type allele (LOH) or copy‑number changes favoring mutant allele. Ovarian carcinoma: tumor_fraction 0.3 → expected heterozygous VAF ≈15%; observed 73.24% strongly implies LOH and/or clonal amplification of mutant allele. Caveats: exact allele‑specific copy‑number, read depth, stromal contamination, and technical biases were not provided; confirm with allele‑specific CN analysis and read depth metrics.

## Q5 (025_5)

Multiple subclonal somatic truncating NF2 alterations (VAFs 55.6% and 9.87%) and truncating FBXW7 (VAF 9.44%) were identified in the osteosarcoma. How would you assess the therapeutic relevance of these alterations for targeted therapy or trial selection, and what actionable pathways or agents (if any) should be prioritized for consideration?

### Answer 5

NF2 loss (merlin) can activate Hippo/YAP and PI3K/mTOR/FAK signaling and provides rationale for trials targeting these pathways (FAK inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors). The NF2 splice variant at VAF 55.6% in a 90% tumor suggests a clonal event and higher therapeutic relevance; the low‑VAF NF2 and FBXW7 events are likely subclonal. FBXW7 loss can stabilize oncogenic substrates (e.g., cyclin E) but has limited direct targeted options; downstream pathway targeting (mTOR, CDK2) is investigational. Prioritize trial enrollment targeting NF2‑associated pathways or basket trials accepting NF2 loss; document clonality when discussing eligibility.

## Q6 (025_6)

Should immune checkpoint inhibition (e.g., pembrolizumab) be considered for this patient’s osteosarcoma or ovarian carcinoma given the TP53 mutation and absence of reported MSI/TMB data, and what additional tests or clinical considerations would be required before pursuing PD‑1 blockade in a patient with LFS?

### Answer 6

TP53 mutation alone is not a validated biomarker for PD‑1 benefit. Test MSI (PCR/IHC) and TMB (NGS panel) before considering ICI; PD‑L1 IHC may also be informative in some tumors. LFS patients may have distinct toxicity risk (reports of significant toxicity in some LFS patients receiving pembrolizumab); involve MTB/genetics. In ovarian high‑grade serous carcinoma and osteosarcoma, single‑agent checkpoint inhibitor activity is limited unless MSI‑high/TMB‑high or other supportive biomarkers exist. Prefer clinical trials or biomarker‑driven ICI use rather than empiric PD‑1 blockade.

## Q7 (025_7)

The patient experienced severe kidney toxicity that necessitated de‑escalation of carboplatin/paclitaxel to carboplatin monotherapy for ovarian cancer. If palbociclib were to be considered in a patient with similar renal impairment, how should dosing be adjusted and which organ‑function tests are required for safe administration?

### Answer 7

Palbociclib is metabolized primarily via hepatic CYP3A; no starting dose adjustment is required for mild or moderate renal impairment (CrCl ≥30 mL/min) per label; data in severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) are limited and warrant caution. Required monitoring: CBC for neutropenia prior to each cycle and during early cycles; hepatic function tests (AST/ALT, bilirubin) for dose adjustments in hepatic impairment. Review concomitant medications that affect CYP3A; in renal impairment, assess overall medication safety and MTB risk–benefit.

## Q8 (025_8)

Outline a recommended surveillance plan for this patient going forward given LFS status (germline TP53), prior cancers, and exposure to multiple systemic therapies, incorporating guideline‑recommended modalities and frequency.

### Answer 8

Follow Toronto Protocol–based surveillance for germline TP53 carriers: annual whole‑body MRI, annual brain MRI (or as part of WBMRI), frequent clinical examinations, directed imaging as indicated, and age‑appropriate breast surveillance (e.g., annual breast MRI per guidelines for carriers assigned female). Avoid unnecessary ionizing radiation; use MRI/PET‑MRI judiciously. Coordinate surveillance with genetics and multidisciplinary teams; provide psychosocial support.

---

## Q9 (025_9)

Describe the recommended genetic counseling and cascade testing approach for the patient’s relatives, including the implications of a likely de novo TP53 pathogenic variant for recurrence risk and reproductive planning.

### Answer 9

Offer genetic counseling and cascade testing to first‑degree relatives. If the variant is de novo, recurrence risk to siblings is low but parental germline mosaicism remains possible; offspring of the proband have a 50% risk of transmission. Discuss reproductive options including preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT‑M) and prenatal testing. Refer relatives to specialized hereditary cancer clinics and initiate tailored surveillance for carriers.

## Q10 (025_10)

If the patient's ovarian carcinoma develops clinical progression after olaparib, list prioritized next‑line management options, including mechanisms of resistance you would investigate, and trial strategies that should be considered based on her molecular profile and performance status.

### Answer 10

Resistance mechanisms to PARP inhibitors include BRCA reversion mutations restoring homologous recombination, alterations restoring replication fork protection, drug efflux, and other bypass mechanisms. On progression, obtain re‑biopsy and broad NGS (to assess for BRCA reversion and emergent actionable alterations), reassess HRD status, and consider circulating tumor DNA for dynamic monitoring. Prioritized options: platinum‑based chemotherapy if platinum‑sensitive and tolerable; enrollment in trials combining PARP with ATR inhibitors, POLQ inhibitors, or other agents targeting reversion mechanisms; consider ATR‑inhibitor trials (especially if ATR pathway alterations are present). Manage within MTB with trial prioritization.
