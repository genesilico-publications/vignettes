## Case

# Case vignette: Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) with somatic and germline BRCA2 mutations

## Key demographics and history
- Age / sex: 81-year-old male
- Relevant family history: Son diagnosed with breast cancer at age 49; son shares the same germline BRCA2 mutation (p.E2877*; ClinVar 67304)
- Comorbidities: Not explicitly reported in the manuscript; no chronic organ dysfunction documented prior to presentation

## Presentation and timeline
- Initial presentation: Stony hard nodule on digital rectal exam of the right prostate lobe; serum PSA low at 0.78 ng/mL despite high-grade disease
- Neurologic symptoms: Reduced motivation and acute neurologic deterioration prompting emergent head CT/MRI that identified a ring-enhancing right frontal lobe mass
- Staging on initial workup: cT3bN1M1c with metastatic involvement of brain, lung (right lobe pulmonary nodule), and multiple bone metastases by 99mTc-HMDP bone scan
- Procedures: Emergent craniotomy with decompression/biopsy of brain lesion and transrectal prostate needle biopsy performed during the same admission

## Pathology (primary and metastatic lesions)
- Prostate needle biopsy and brain metastasis histology: Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with solid and trabecular architecture; Gleason grade 9 (4 + 5) reported for prostate sample
- Neuroendocrine phenotype by immunohistochemistry: Negative for PSA, NKX3.1, and p501S (prostate lineage markers); diffusely positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin A, consistent with adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation (NEPC)
- Consensus diagnosis: Metastatic adenocarcinoma of NEPC (de novo NEPC) based on morphology and concordant IHC between prostate and brain lesions

## Molecular / genomic results
- Tumor (FFPE prostate specimen) and paired peripheral blood sequencing performed using targeted NGS
- Somatic BRCA2 splice-site mutation: c.7008-2A>C identified in tumor tissue
  - Reported variant allele frequency (VAF): ~0.35 (approx. 35%) on the tumor scatter plot
  - Read depth: not reported in the manuscript
- Germline BRCA2 truncating mutation: p.E2877* (p.Glu2877Ter), chr13:g.32945234G>T; ClinVar allele ID 67304 (present in peripheral blood DNA)
- Genomic interpretation in the manuscript: Germline truncating BRCA2 likely abolishes RAD51 binding and the somatic splice-site change likely causes abnormal splicing, consistent with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency

## Biomarkers
- PSA: 0.78 ng/mL at presentation; decreased to <0.01 ng/mL after six cycles of chemotherapy
- Neuron-specific enolase (NSE): Decreased to <11.8 ng/mL after 5 months of therapy (consistent with response of neuroendocrine component)
- No PD-L1, MSI, TMB, FISH, or other IHC biomarkers were reported

## Prior and index treatments
- Androgen-deprivation therapy (chemical castration) initiated (details of agent not specified)
- Systemic chemotherapy: Received platinum-based doublet chemotherapy combined with etoposide (regimen details and doses not specified in the report) — six cycles over ~5 months
  - Response: Complete radiographic remission of pulmonary metastasis and complete radiographic remission of the frontal-lobe brain metastasis after therapy (manuscript: partial remission of brain metastasis after five cycles and complete remission on follow-up imaging); PSA nadir <0.01 ng/mL after cycle 6
  - Tolerability: Patient completed six cycles; specific toxicities not reported in the paper

## Current status (as reported)
- Radiographic response: CR in lung, CR in brain metastasis on follow-up imaging; bone disease described on initial bone scan but follow-up bone response not explicitly reported
- Performance status and organ function: Not explicitly quantified (ECOG not reported). The patient underwent craniotomy and six cycles of platinum/etoposide, suggesting clinical fitness sufficient for major surgery and multi-cycle chemotherapy

## Clinical interpretation and implications
- The combination of a germline truncating BRCA2 mutation and an additional somatic BRCA2 splice-site alteration suggests biallelic BRCA2 inactivation with functional HR deficiency, explaining marked sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy
- This patient would be considered for PARP inhibitor therapy (e.g., olaparib or rucaparib where approved) in the setting of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with deleterious germline or somatic BRCA2 alterations, per pivotal trials (PROfound, TRITON3) and regulatory approvals
- Germline BRCA2 finding has implications for cascade testing and cancer surveillance in relatives; the son is already known to carry the variant and had breast cancer
- Management of intracranial disease in prostate cancer remains individualized; this case demonstrates that systemic platinum-based chemotherapy can produce intracranial responses in HR-deficient disease, but local therapy (surgical resection, radiation) remains part of multidisciplinary care depending on symptoms and control

## Q1 (036_1)

Does this patient have evidence consistent with biallelic BRCA2 inactivation, and how does the reported tumor VAF (~0.35) influence this interpretation?

### Answer 1

Yes. The germline truncating BRCA2 variant (p.E2877*) in peripheral blood combined with a tumor somatic BRCA2 splice-site alteration (c.7008-2A>C) is most consistent with biallelic BRCA2 inactivation causing homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). The observed tumor VAF of ~0.35 indicates the somatic event is present in a substantial tumor fraction but, in the absence of reported read depth and copy-number or LOH data, does not alone prove zygosity. The biologic inference is strengthened by (1) a protein-truncating germline allele, (2) a second somatic disruptive event in tumor tissue, and (3) the clinical platinum sensitivity observed. Confirmatory copy-number/LOH analysis or allele-specific read-depth would formally establish biallelic loss.

## Q2 (036_2)

If the patient later progresses to castration-resistant disease after modern AR-directed therapy, is treatment with a PARP inhibitor appropriate, and which regulatory-backed agents are supported by high-level evidence for BRCA2-mutant mCRPC?

### Answer 2

Yes. PARP inhibitor therapy is appropriate for mCRPC with deleterious germline or somatic BRCA2 alterations after progression on AR-directed therapy. Olaparib demonstrated benefit in the phase 3 PROfound trial and is FDA-approved for HRR gene–mutated mCRPC (including BRCA2). Rucaparib has obtained regulatory approval for BRCA-mutated mCRPC based on TRITON program data. Selection should be guided by confirmed deleterious BRCA2 status and prior therapies.

---

## Q3 (036_3)

Given the marked radiographic response to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in this patient, should platinum agents be considered part of standard therapy for NEPC with BRCA2 alterations, and what evidence supports their use in this context?

### Answer 3

Platinum-containing regimens are appropriate and commonly used for NEPC (especially poorly differentiated or small-cell–like histologies). For BRCA2-mutant tumors, biologic rationale and accumulating clinical reports and series indicate increased platinum sensitivity because HRD impairs repair of platinum-induced DNA crosslinks. Evidence includes case reports, series, and reviews showing activity of platinum in HRR-deficient prostate cancers; however, randomized data are limited and platinum is used based on histology and biomarker context.

---

## Q4 (036_4)

Should PARP inhibitor maintenance be initiated immediately after achieving a radiographic complete/near-complete response to platinum in this patient, or should PARP inhibitors be reserved for progression?

### Answer 4

There is no established standard to institute routine PARP inhibitor maintenance immediately after platinum-induced response in metastatic prostate cancer. Pivotal PARP trials evaluated PARP therapy for progressive mCRPC after AR-targeted therapy, not as post-platinum maintenance. Therefore, PARP inhibitors should generally be reserved for appropriate indications (e.g., mCRPC with deleterious BRCA2) or used within a clinical trial testing maintenance strategies.

---

## Q5 (036_5)

How does the neuroendocrine phenotype and low PSA (0.78 ng/mL at presentation) affect monitoring strategy and eligibility for PARP-inhibitor trials and approved indications?

### Answer 5

Low PSA and NEPC histology reduce the utility of PSA for monitoring; serial imaging and neuroendocrine markers (e.g., NSE) and clinical assessment are preferred for disease surveillance. PARP inhibitor eligibility is genotype-driven (deleterious HRR alterations) and generally depends on prior therapy lines rather than PSA level; thus low PSA does not preclude PARP therapy if genomic and prior-treatment criteria are met.

---

## Q6 (036_6)

What considerations apply to prescribing PARP inhibitors in patients with prior brain metastases who have had resection and radiographic control, as in this case?

### Answer 6

Many PARP trials excluded patients with active symptomatic CNS disease; clinical data on intracranial activity in prostate cancer are limited and PARP agents have variable CNS penetration. For treated, controlled brain metastases without progressive neurologic symptoms, PARP inhibitor therapy can be considered with multidisciplinary input and close CNS surveillance. If intracranial disease is active or symptomatic, definitive local therapy (surgery/radiation) should be prioritized before systemic PARP therapy.

---

## Q7 (036_7)

What are the most likely molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors in BRCA2-mutant prostate cancer, which assays would detect them, and how would they change management for this patient?

### Answer 7

Common resistance mechanisms include secondary (reversion) BRCA2 mutations restoring reading frame and HR function, restoration of HR via compensatory pathway changes, PARP1 alterations, and pharmacologic mechanisms (drug efflux). These are detectable by repeat tumor or plasma (ctDNA) NGS to identify reversion mutations and copy-number changes; functional HRD assays may also help. Detection of reversion events generally predicts PARP resistance and would prompt a shift to non–PARP therapies (taxane chemotherapy, clinical trials targeting PARP-resistant mechanisms).

---

## Q8 (036_8)

If the patient develops mCRPC after prior platinum, what sequence of therapies (AR-targeted agents, taxane chemotherapy, PARP inhibitors, radionuclide therapy) is supported by current evidence for a BRCA2-mutant NEPC patient, and how would age/comorbidity affect prioritization?

### Answer 8

For BRCA2-mutant mCRPC, PARP inhibitors (olaparib, rucaparib where approved) are supported after progression on AR-directed therapy. Taxane chemotherapy remains standard (docetaxel, cabazitaxel) and is often preferred for rapidly progressive or symptomatic disease; NEPC histology often responds to platinum-based regimens. Radionuclide therapy (177Lu-PSMA) requires PSMA expression and may be less effective in NEPC. In an elderly (81-year-old) patient, ECOG, organ function, and comorbidities may favor less-intensive or single-agent approaches and enrollment in trials; dose modifications or supportive measures should be individualized.

---

## Q9 (036_9)

Which additional molecular tests (tumor or blood) would you order now to refine treatment selection and clinical-trial matching for this patient, and why?

### Answer 9

Recommended tests: (a) Comprehensive tumor NGS including copy-number analysis to confirm biallelic status and to identify co-alterations (TP53, RB1, etc.); (b) ctDNA NGS to assess heterogeneity and potential resistance mechanisms; (c) formal germline confirmation and genetic counseling for cascade testing (already documented); (d) MSI/TMB and PD-L1 if immunotherapy is being considered in a trial; (e) PSMA PET to assess radionuclide therapy candidacy. These tests refine therapy selection and trial eligibility and enable monitoring for acquired resistance.

## Q10 (036_10)

What cascade testing and risk-management recommendations should be made for first-degree relatives given the germline BRCA2 truncating variant (p.E2877*) identified in this proband?

### Answer 10

Recommend genetic counseling and predictive germline testing for first-degree relatives. Relatives who carry the pathogenic BRCA2 variant should be offered guideline-based surveillance and risk-reduction strategies: for men, earlier or more intensive prostate-cancer screening and awareness of increased risk; for women, breast/ovarian surveillance and prevention per hereditary breast-ovarian cancer guidelines. The proband's son already carries the variant and had breast cancer, consistent with heritable BRCA2-mediated risk.
