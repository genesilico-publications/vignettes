## Case

# Case vignette — Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with PTEN loss

## Patient demographics and relevant history
- Age/sex: 62-year-old man.
- Relevant past medical history: Stage II chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) under observation; prior right nephrectomy for stage I clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (no systemic therapy required).
- Family history: Family history of prostate cancer.
- Initial prostate cancer characteristics: Localized, high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma; pre-operative PSA 19.7 ng/mL; biopsy Gleason score 4 + 5 = 9 in all cores.

## Primary treatment and early course
- September 2016: Radical prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy.
- Final pathology: pT3bN0, Gleason 4 + 5 = 9, invasion of periprostatic fat and seminal vesicles, perineural invasion, positive surgical margins.
- Postoperative PSA: 2.39 ng/mL; patient received bicalutamide plus leuprolide for 6 months with subsequent undetectable PSA. No salvage radiation was administered.
- Germline testing (Ambry CancerNext®): negative.

## Presentation and pattern of metastatic disease (timeline, symptoms)
- January 2020: Presents with 2 months of lower abdominal pain, anal spasms, constipation, and severe lower urinary tract symptoms (IPSS 33). No weight loss.
- PSA trend: documented PSA 2.3 ng/mL (Dec 2019), then 11.70 ng/mL at initial oncology visit (Jan 2020) and rising to 41.78 ng/mL within 4 weeks.
- Staging imaging (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis + bone scan): numerous liver lesions; sub-centimeter supraclavicular, mediastinal and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy; bone scan negative for osseous metastases.
- FDG PET/CT: multiple FDG-avid liver lesions (SUVs up to 11), hypermetabolic bilateral iliac nodes, no convincing FDG activity in small thoracic nodes above blood pool.

## Pathology and biomarkers
- Liver biopsy (first, and later second biopsy): metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma.
  - IHC: Diffuse nuclear NKX3.1 positivity and diffuse cytoplasmic PSA positivity; chromogranin and synaptophysin negative — consistent with maintained prostatic lineage and absence of neuroendocrine differentiation.
  - Histologic features: high nuclear pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli, high mitotic index, comedo-type central necrosis and single-cell necrosis — features of aggressive, therapy-resistant adenocarcinoma.
- Molecular/genomic findings reported in the case: PTEN loss (case title and discussion emphasize PTEN loss). The primary report does not provide variant allele frequency (VAF), read depth, exact assay platform, copy-number details, or MSI/TMB values in the published text. (Noted: the presence of PTEN loss is a central molecular finding for this case.)

## Prior systemic therapies, course and responses
- Docetaxel (6 cycles; Mar–Jun 2020): PSA decreased to ~1.7 ng/mL; modest radiographic lesion reduction (~2.2 cm → ~1.7 cm) — initial sensitivity.
- Enzalutamide (Jun–Aug 2020): PSA ~1.6 ng/mL; radiographic stability (~1.6 cm) — temporary control.
- Cabazitaxel (3 cycles; Sep–Oct 2020): rapid biochemical and radiographic progression (PSA ≈45 ng/mL; lesions increased to ~4.5 cm; new lesions) — treatment failure.

## Salvage / later therapy and local liver-directed therapy
- November 2020 onward: Combination therapy with carboplatin (platinum), abiraterone acetate + prednisone, plus liver-directed radioembolization (Y-90) to right lobe (Nov 2020) and left lobe (Dec 2020) in sequence.
- Response after combined approach: Partial biochemical and radiographic response with PSA peak near 185 ng/mL at time of therapy initiation (Nov 2020), then decline after Y-90; lesion sizes decreased (from 6.4 cm → ~5.0–5.5 cm), and disease stabilization on follow-up imaging and PSA (~55 ng/mL Feb–Mar 2021).

## Current status reported in manuscript
- Disease: Liver-dominant metastatic CRPC with prior multi-line therapy and PTEN loss.
- Phenotype: Maintained androgen receptor lineage (NKX3.1 and PSA positive), no neuroendocrine transformation.
- Performance status and organ function: The manuscript does not specify ECOG performance status numerically; clinical description indicates preserved appetite and maintenance of weight at presentation; hepatic function data (bilirubin, transaminases, synthetic function) are not reported in detail in the manuscript text.

## Key clinical questions and takeaways highlighted by the case
- PTEN loss present in mCRPC is common (incidence increases with castration resistance) and is associated with poor prognosis; it may predict sensitivity to PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors in combination with androgen-receptor pathway inhibitors (e.g., ipatasertib + abiraterone in PTEN-loss subgroups in trials).
- The patient experienced modest benefit from a combined strategy of carboplatin + abiraterone + liver-directed Y-90 radioembolization after progression on standard chemotherapies (docetaxel, cabazitaxel) and androgen-signaling inhibitors (enzalutamide).
- The mechanistic basis for response is uncertain; available evidence supports consideration of platinum chemotherapy for aggressive variant prostate cancers or selected molecular subtypes, consideration of PI3K/AKT pathway targeting in PTEN-loss tumors, and locoregional therapy for liver-dominant disease in selected patients.

## Limitations and missing data from the published report
- No detailed genomic data provided (no VAFs, no platform, no copy-number log2 ratios, no MSI/TMB reporting).
- No quantitative ECOG PS or complete organ function labs provided in the manuscript text.
- PTEN loss modality (IHC vs genomic deletion by NGS/CNV) not explicitly detailed in the case report text.

## Q1 (028_1)

Given this patient’s documented PTEN loss, prior exposure to novel hormonal therapy (enzalutamide and later abiraterone), and preserved androgen-receptor lineage on tumor IHC, would adding an AKT inhibitor such as ipatasertib to abiraterone be an evidence-based option now, and under what conditions should it be recommended?

### Answer 1

Addition of an AKT inhibitor (ipatasertib) to abiraterone showed clinically meaningful improvement in radiographic progression-free survival in the PTEN-loss subgroup of the randomized IPATential150 trial; benefit was concentrated in PTEN-loss tumors as assessed by IHC. However, adoption into routine practice depends on regulatory approvals and local availability, and ipatasertib is best used within a clinical trial or per regulatory guidance. For this patient, confirmatory PTEN testing modality (IHC vs genomic deletion) and performance status/organ function would be required before considering therapy; referral to a clinical trial of AKT inhibition + AR-targeted therapy is an appropriate pathway.

---

## Q2 (028_2)

Is a PARP inhibitor (olaparib) indicated for this patient now based on the available data in the case report, and what additional genomic information would be required to consider olaparib?

### Answer 2

Olaparib is indicated in mCRPC patients with qualifying deleterious germline or somatic homologous-recombination repair (HRR) gene alterations (e.g., BRCA1/2, PALB2, ATM under certain contexts) as shown in the PROfound/olaparib program. The published case reports a negative germline panel (Ambry CancerNext®) but does not report somatic tumor NGS for HRR alterations. Therefore, olaparib is not currently indicated based on the available information; tumor somatic NGS (or ctDNA profiling) to identify actionable HRR mutations is required to consider olaparib.

---

## Q3 (028_3)

Would 177Lu‑PSMA‑617 radioligand therapy (RLT) be an appropriate next-line option for this patient, and what imaging and prior-therapy prerequisites must be confirmed before eligibility?

### Answer 3

177Lu‑PSMA‑617 (as studied in the VISION trial) improved overall survival and radiographic PFS in PSMA-PET–positive mCRPC patients who had previously received an ARPI and at least one taxane. This patient has received AR-targeted agents and taxanes (docetaxel, cabazitaxel), so he would meet prior-therapy prerequisites if PSMA-PET demonstrates sufficient PSMA expression and organ function (especially adequate bone marrow and renal/hepatic function). PSMA PET imaging (e.g., 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT) is required; FDG-PET positivity alone is not sufficient for selection. Therefore, RLT is a reasonable option if PSMA-PET is positive and the patient meets organ-function criteria.

---

## Q4 (028_4)

For a patient with progressive, liver‑dominant mCRPC who received Y‑90 radioembolization with partial radiographic/biochemical response as in this case, what is the evidence and recommended patient selection for Y‑90 therapy in prostate cancer liver metastases?

### Answer 4

Evidence for Y-90 selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) in prostate cancer is limited to case series and small retrospective reports; it can provide local control and palliation in liver‑dominant disease but is not curative. Selection requires liver-dominant disease, acceptable hepatic reserve (bilirubin, albumin, INR), and multidisciplinary assessment. Y-90 may be considered for symptom control or to reduce dominant hepatic tumor burden, particularly when systemic options are limited or to combine with systemic therapy, but it is not standard-of-care based on randomized evidence in prostate cancer.

---

## Q5 (028_5)

Does this patient's clinical course (rapid biochemical rise, visceral liver metastases, high-grade histology, and poor response to cabazitaxel) meet criteria for an aggressive-variant prostate cancer (AVPC) phenotype, and how should that influence systemic therapy selection (including the role of platinum chemotherapy)?

### Answer 5

The clinical features (visceral metastases—liver, high-grade Gleason 9, rapid progression on taxane, high mitotic index and necrosis on pathology) raise concern for an aggressive-variant phenotype. AVPC is a clinico-pathologic construct that may benefit from platinum-containing regimens in select patients. The randomized phase 1–2 study by Corn et al. demonstrated activity of cabazitaxel plus carboplatin in men with mCRPC, particularly in a molecularly defined aggressive subgroup; thus, platinum-containing chemotherapy is a reasonable consideration for AVPC or when features suggest lineage plasticity/chemo‑sensitive histology. In this patient the treating team used carboplatin with some benefit, consistent with available evidence.

## Q6 (028_6)

How should the documented PTEN loss (without provided VAF or assay details) be confirmed and reported to optimally guide targeted therapy or trial enrollment, and why are assay modality and clonality important?

### Answer 6

PTEN loss should be confirmed with a specified test and report format: either validated PTEN IHC showing protein loss or tumor NGS/CNV analysis demonstrating PTEN homozygous deletion or truncating mutation with allele-specific copy-number context. Reports should include assay platform, detection method (IHC vs NGS), VAF for mutations, read depth, and copy-number metrics (log2 ratio or estimated copy number) because these affect interpretation of biallelic inactivation/clonality and potential predictive value for PI3K/AKT pathway–targeted therapies. If only single-allele loss or subclonal alteration is present, predictive value for AKT inhibition is less certain.

---

## Q7 (028_7)

If tumor or ctDNA sequencing reveals a somatic ATM loss-of-function variant at 10% VAF with read depth 500x, what is the implication for PARP inhibitor therapy and how should this finding be interpreted for this patient specifically?

### Answer 7

ATM mutations are considered HRR-related but responses to PARP inhibitors (e.g., olaparib) are generally more modest for ATM alterations compared with BRCA1/2. A 10% VAF at 500x read depth suggests a subclonal or low‑fraction event (approximate tumor fraction or heterozygosity must be interpreted relative to tumor purity and copy-number state). Because PARP inhibitor benefit is most robust for biallelic BRCA1/2 loss, an isolated low‑VAF ATM variant would not be a definitive biomarker for PARP monotherapy; confirmatory testing (assess for biallelic inactivation, loss of heterozygosity, or higher clonal fraction) and multidisciplinary discussion or clinical-trial enrollment would be recommended. If biallelic ATM inactivation is confirmed, PARP inhibitor use could be considered, recognizing the lower magnitude of benefit and variable guideline recommendations.

## Q8 (028_8)

If the patient now develops progressive hepatic dysfunction (bilirubin rises to 3.5 mg/dL, INR 1.6, albumin 2.8 g/dL), how would that alter further systemic therapy choices and the feasibility of additional liver-directed Y‑90 therapy?

### Answer 8

Significant hepatic dysfunction (bilirubin >2–3 mg/dL, compromised synthetic function) is a contraindication or major caution for Y‑90 radioembolization because of risk of radiation-induced liver disease and worsening hepatic failure. Many systemic agents (e.g., abiraterone) require dose adjustment or hold for severe hepatic impairment; cytotoxic regimens (carboplatin) also require careful dose modification and may be unsafe with poor synthetic function. PSMA RLT eligibility depends partly on organ-function criteria, and severe hepatic dysfunction may preclude safe administration. Therefore, in the presence of bilirubin 3.5 mg/dL and hypoalbuminemia/increased INR, focus should shift to best supportive care, careful dose-reduced systemic therapy if any, and multidisciplinary palliation rather than Y-90 or aggressive hepatotoxic systemic options.

---

## Q9 (028_9)

Considering the patient’s prior treatment history (docetaxel → enzalutamide → cabazitaxel progression) and current disease features (PTEN loss, liver-dominant metastases), propose a prioritized next-line therapeutic strategy (three-step sequence) reflecting current evidence and trial opportunities.

### Answer 9

A prioritized, evidence-anchored approach (subject to PSMA imaging and somatic genomic results) would be:
1. Comprehensive tumor/ctDNA NGS and PSMA PET/CT to identify actionable HRR alterations (for PARP inhibitor eligibility), PSMA positivity (for 177Lu‑PSMA‑617), and to validate PTEN loss modality; this testing directs subsequent therapy.
2. If PSMA-PET positive and organ function adequate: consider 177Lu‑PSMA‑617 per VISION eligibility (given prior ARPI + taxane exposure). If PSMA negative but HRR mutation (esp. BRCA1/2) present: olaparib per label. If neither, consider platinum-containing chemotherapy (e.g., cabazitaxel + carboplatin or carboplatin-containing regimen) for an AVPC-like presentation, or an AKT-inhibitor trial if PTEN loss confirmed.
3. Where available, enroll in clinical trials targeting PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway (ipatasertib), combination PARP + ARPI trials, or other precision medicine trials (consider early-phase options). Concurrent multidisciplinary assessment for liver-directed therapy (repeat embolization, local control) may be considered for symptomatic or dominant hepatic disease.

## Q10 (028_10)

List the essential additional biomarker tests and imaging studies you would order now to refine therapy decisions for this patient, and explain how each will change management.

### Answer 10

Essential tests and how they inform management:
- Tumor tissue NGS (comprehensive panel including HRR genes and copy-number analysis): to detect somatic BRCA1/2, PALB2, ATM, and to confirm PTEN biallelic loss; would determine PARP inhibitor eligibility and trial matches.
- Plasma ctDNA comprehensive assay (if tissue not available): rapid alternative for HRR detection; may identify actionable mutations and tumor fraction.
- PSMA PET/CT (68Ga-PSMA or 18F-DCFPyL): required to assess eligibility for 177Lu-PSMA-617 and to map disease burden for locoregional therapies.
- Repeat liver MRI with contrast and formal hepatology labs (bilirubin, ALT/AST, albumin, INR) and MELD score: to determine safety of Y-90 and to quantify liver reserve.
- IHC confirmation for PTEN (if not already done) and AR/NE markers; assessment of neuroendocrine markers if AVPC suspected: to refine phenotype and trial eligibility.
- MSI/MMR testing and tumor mutational burden (TMB) if possible (though MSI-H is uncommon in prostate cancer): would identify rare checkpoint inhibitor–eligible patients.
