## Title
Case 16-2012: A 32-Year-Old Woman with HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer — Chronologic, high-fidelity vignette for precision-oncology assessment

## Demographics and relevant history
- Age: 32 years
- Sex: Female
- Obstetric/menstrual status: Premenopausal; menarche at 11; current menses; three children (youngest 14 months at presentation)
- Relevant personal history: Breast-feeding at time of symptom recognition; prior idiopathic thrombocytopenia during first full-term pregnancy; history of endometriosis; prior intermittent depot medroxyprogesterone acetate use; prior oral contraceptive use for 3–4 years
- Family history: Maternal second cousin and two maternal great-aunts with breast cancer (one in her 40s, others older); paternal grandparents with lung and colon cancer
- Medications: Carbamazepine, calcium, vitamins

## Presentation and timeline
- ~2 months prior to presentation: Noted a crease in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast while breast-feeding
- ~3 weeks before evaluation: Palpable mass in right upper outer quadrant discovered at routine gynecologic exam
- Mammography at outside hospital: Heterogeneous spiculated ~2-cm mass in right breast with skin thickening
- Ultrasound (outside): Hyperechogenic area at the site of palpable mass
- 4 days later: Core-needle biopsy of right-breast mass → invasive ductal carcinoma (moderately differentiated on initial report), DCIS (intermediate–high nuclear grade)
- IHC on core biopsy: HER2 3+ (uniform, intense membrane staining >30% of invasive cells); ER negative; PR negative
- BRCA1/2 testing: reportedly negative

- Next day: Breast MRI with gadolinium — dense breasts, marked background enhancement (lactational); two spiculated enhancing masses at 10 o'clock in right breast: posterior ~2.0 cm (palpable) and anterior ~1.6–1.8 cm (biopsied)
- Positron-emission tomography (17 mCi 18F-FDG): intense uptake in right breast, two small foci in right axilla (suspicious for nodal metastases), subtle focus at tip of left scapula
- Bone scan (performed subsequently): No metastatic disease seen
- Contrast chest CT: Marked enlargement of right breast with skin thickening, small right axillary nodes (<1 cm), 2-mm nonspecific left lower-lobe pulmonary nodule
- CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast: Multiple solid hepatic lesions (≤1.6 cm) — interpreted as hepatic metastases
- Transthoracic echocardiography: Normal left ventricular function

## Clinical stage at presentation (clinical impression)
- Locally advanced right-breast invasive ductal carcinoma, HER2-positive, ER/PR-negative, with radiologic evidence of visceral metastases to the liver (multiple lesions) and possible osseous and nodal involvement — de novo stage IV disease.

## Baseline labs and performance status
- White-cell count: 3800/mm3 (mild leukopenia)
- Other CBC parameters, electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, renal and hepatic function tests: reported as normal at baseline
- Performance status: Excellent (able to care for young children, no constitutional symptoms); inferred ECOG 0–1
- Cardiac function: Normal (baseline echocardiography)

## Pathology (pre-treatment)
- Core-needle biopsy: High-grade invasive ductal carcinoma (grade 3 of 3) spanning ≥1.0 cm; focal high-grade DCIS with comedonecrosis
- Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified in the initial core
- IHC: HER2 3+ (strong circumferential membrane staining), ER negative, PR negative
- HER2 testing performed in a validated laboratory; FISH was not required initially (IHC 3+ sufficed)

## Molecular/genomic testing
- BRCA1/BRCA2 germline testing: negative (reported)
- No next-generation sequencing data, no somatic point-mutation VAFs or read-depths reported in the case; HER2 amplification demonstrated on FISH in mastectomy specimen (post-neoadjuvant)

## Initial systemic therapy and response
- Systemic regimen chosen: Docetaxel + carboplatin + trastuzumab (q3 weeks), based on phase II/phase III data suggesting activity of taxane + trastuzumab and data supporting platinum combinations in HER2+ disease at the time
- Clinical response: After 2 cycles, significant reduction in palpable disease and resolution of skin changes; after 4 cycles, imaging demonstrated complete radiographic resolution of all previously enhancing hepatic lesions and resolution of axillary disease
- Total delivered: 8 cycles of docetaxel + carboplatin + trastuzumab, followed by trastuzumab maintenance monotherapy

## Local therapy
- Because of exceptional systemic response and young age with good performance status, right mastectomy with immediate reconstruction was performed during trastuzumab maintenance (local control for symptomatic/tissue control and to avoid further cytotoxic therapy)

## Surgical pathology (post-neoadjuvant)
- Mastectomy specimen: Residual high-grade invasive carcinoma in the form of single cells and small clusters within treatment-effect stroma; residual high-grade DCIS with comedonecrosis and calcifications
- FISH on surgical specimen: Persistent HER2 gene amplification (confirmatory of target retention)
- Overall pathologic assessment: Partial response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy with residual invasive disease and persistent HER2 amplification

## Subsequent course
- Continued trastuzumab monotherapy after surgery
- At follow-up reported in the case: 1.5 years after mastectomy and 2.5 years after diagnosis — no evidence of recurrent disease on imaging; intermittent transient neurologic symptoms prompted brain MRI which was negative
- Clinical concern documented: elevated risk for CNS metastases in HER2-positive disease treated with trastuzumab; routine screening for asymptomatic brain metastases not recommended in absence of neurologic signs

## Key precision-oncology data points for question design
- HER2 status: IHC 3+ with persistent HER2 amplification by FISH on surgical specimen
- ER/PR status: negative (triple-negative for hormone receptors)
- Germline BRCA1/2: negative
- Extent of metastatic disease at presentation: multiple hepatic metastases (≤1.6 cm), small pulmonary nodule (2 mm), possible bony lesion (scapula), axillary nodal uptake on PET
- Treatment received: carboplatin + docetaxel + trastuzumab ×8 cycles → trastuzumab maintenance; mastectomy with residual disease; continued trastuzumab monotherapy with ongoing disease-free interval at last follow-up
- Cardiac function: preserved at baseline; no anthracycline exposure reported prior to trastuzumab

## Q1 (004_1)

In this 32-year-old premenopausal woman with de novo HER2-amplified, ER/PR-negative metastatic breast cancer who initially received docetaxel + carboplatin + trastuzumab, what would be the guideline-preferred first-line systemic regimen today, and how should the prior choice (carboplatin inclusion) be interpreted relative to current level-1 evidence?

### Answer 1

Preferred first-line regimen today for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer with preserved cardiac function is pertuzumab + trastuzumab + a taxane (commonly docetaxel), per CLEOPATRA and current NCCN guidance. CLEOPATRA showed improved PFS and OS when pertuzumab was added to trastuzumab + docetaxel. The BCIRG-007 randomized trial did not show an OS advantage for routine addition of carboplatin to docetaxel + trastuzumab, so carboplatin is not required by current level-1 evidence; its inclusion is an acceptable real-world variant in select patients but is not the category-1 preferred regimen. In this patient with normal baseline LVEF and visceral (hepatic) metastases, CLEOPATRA-type therapy would be the contemporary standard; the regimen she received produced a deep response but would not replace the category-1 first-line standard today.

## Q2 (004_2)

Given that this patient had a complete radiographic resolution of hepatic metastases after systemic therapy but persistent residual invasive disease in the breast at surgery, what is the recommended approach to tissue confirmation of metastatic disease at baseline and at the time of dissociated responses, and how should persistent HER2 amplification on surgical FISH be interpreted for ongoing HER2-targeted therapy selection?

### Answer 2

Histologic confirmation of metastatic disease should be strongly considered when presentation is atypical or lesions are few or in unusual sites; however, when multiple hepatic lesions are present and imaging strongly supports metastases (as in this patient), systemic therapy may be initiated without biopsy. If discordant/dissociated responses develop (progression in one site with response elsewhere), biopsy of the progressing lesion is recommended to confirm histology and reassess biomarkers (HER2, ER/PR) because receptor conversion can occur. Persistent HER2 amplification on surgical FISH confirms target retention and supports continued HER2-directed therapy and sequencing of other HER2-targeted agents on progression.

## Q3 (004_3)

If this patient later experiences systemic progression while on trastuzumab monotherapy (having previously received a taxane and trastuzumab), which anti‑HER2 agent has the highest-level evidence to be used next-line as of current practice, and how would you sequence trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) versus trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) for this patient specifically?

### Answer 3

Historically, T-DM1 (trastuzumab emtansine) was the standard next-line therapy after progression on trastuzumab + taxane based on EMILIA. More recently, DESTINY-Breast03 demonstrated superior PFS and response rates for trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) compared with T-DM1, establishing T-DXd as the preferred second-line agent for most patients previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. For this young patient with visceral disease and retained HER2 amplification, T-DXd would now generally be favored over T-DM1 unless contraindicated (e.g., significant interstitial lung disease risk). Tucatinib-based regimens are important when CNS disease is present.

## Q4 (004_4)

If the patient develops new brain metastases while on systemic HER2‑directed therapy, which regimen has demonstrated a survival benefit and intracranial activity in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, and how should CNS disease influence systemic agent choice in this patient?

### Answer 4

Tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine (HER2CLIMB) demonstrated improved PFS and OS and showed intracranial benefit, including reduced intracranial progression and improved outcomes in patients with brain metastases; this regimen is recommended for patients with CNS metastases, in conjunction with local CNS-directed therapy as appropriate. CNS disease should prompt consideration of tucatinib-containing therapy (or other agents with intracranial data) and early multidisciplinary CNS management.

---

## Q5 (004_5)

If this patient develops a decline in left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after prolonged trastuzumab exposure, what are the immediate management steps and how would you modify systemic HER2-targeted therapy given the need to balance cardiac safety with oncologic control?

### Answer 5

Immediate management: hold trastuzumab pending repeat LVEF measurement and initiate cardiology evaluation and guideline-based management for heart failure (ACE inhibitor/ARB and beta-blocker as indicated). Reassess LVEF in 3–4 weeks; if LVEF recovers to acceptable range and patient is clinically stable, trastuzumab may be reintroduced with close cardiac monitoring. Modify systemic therapy to avoid concurrent anthracyclines; consider non-anthracycline HER2-targeted strategies and involve cardio-oncology. If trastuzumab is permanently discontinued for cardiotoxicity, consider alternative HER2-directed agents (e.g., T-DXd, tucatinib-based regimens) with cardiology input and individualized risk–benefit assessment.

## Q6 (004_6)

This patient was breast‑feeding at the time of presentation and is premenopausal. What counseling and actions should be undertaken regarding fertility preservation and pregnancy considerations before initiating (or resuming) systemic HER2-directed therapy?

### Answer 6

Offer fertility counseling and discuss fertility-preservation options (oocyte/embryo cryopreservation, ovarian suppression) before cytotoxic therapy. Trastuzumab is contraindicated during pregnancy unless maternal life is at risk because of risks such as oligohydramnios; breastfeeding is not recommended during cytotoxic chemotherapy or trastuzumab. Counsel the patient to avoid pregnancy during systemic HER2-targeted therapy and provide contraception guidance. Document discussion and arrange fertility referrals if fertility is desired post-treatment.

## Q7 (004_7)

If next-generation sequencing (tumor NGS) were obtained on residual invasive tumor from the mastectomy and found an ERBB2 (HER2) kinase-domain point mutation with a measurable variant allele fraction (VAF) of 18% and read depth of 800x, how would this affect therapeutic choices in this patient? Include specific drug classes and trial-supported agents in your answer.

### Answer 7

An ERBB2 kinase-domain activating mutation at VAF 18% with high read depth indicates a true somatic subclonal event. Certain HER2 kinase mutations may confer resistance to some antibodies but can be targetable with irreversible HER2 TKIs (e.g., neratinib) or with combination strategies; the specific mutation guides choice. Because the tumor retains HER2 amplification (IHC 3+/FISH+), ADCs such as T-DXd remain attractive. Consider mutation-directed options (neratinib in appropriate contexts or clinical trials) or ADCs/combination regimens; integrate mutation specifics, prior therapies, organ function, and available trials when sequencing therapy.

## Q8 (004_8)

Design a guideline-anchored salvage strategy if the patient progresses after trastuzumab maintenance and then after second-line T-DXd (assume she received T-DXd and had systemic progression without prohibitive interstitial lung disease). What evidence-based options would you prioritize and why?

### Answer 8

After progression on trastuzumab and T-DXd, prioritize (depending on prior exposures and CNS status): (1) tucatinib + trastuzumab + capecitabine (strong evidence of systemic and intracranial benefit from HER2CLIMB), (2) T-DM1 if not previously used (though DESTINY-Breast03 favored T-DXd over T-DM1 early), (3) clinical-trial enrollment for next-generation ADCs, bispecifics, or novel HER2 agents, and (4) TKIs such as neratinib or other combinations in later lines. Rationale: tucatinib regimen has demonstrated OS and intracranial benefit; ADCs and clinical trials are prioritized because of evolving activity post-ADC exposure.

## Q9 (004_9)

What surveillance strategy for the central nervous system (CNS) is recommended for an asymptomatic patient such as this one who has had a durable systemic response to HER2-directed therapy, and what is the evidence base for that recommendation?

### Answer 9

Routine screening brain MRI in asymptomatic patients is not recommended despite the higher risk of CNS metastases in HER2-positive disease; instead, clinical vigilance with symptom-prompted imaging is the standard because screening studies have not shown a survival benefit. Obtain MRI promptly if neurologic signs or symptoms occur.

---

## Q10 (004_10)

List three clinical-trial or evolving therapeutic approaches (with brief rationale) that would be suitable to discuss with this patient at the time of systemic progression after multiple HER2-directed standard therapies.

### Answer 10

1) Next-generation HER2-directed ADCs — rationale: potent targeted cytotoxic delivery with activity after prior HER2 therapies. 2) Bispecific HER2-targeting antibodies or dual-targeting molecules — rationale: novel mechanisms to engage immune effectors and overcome resistance. 3) Combinations targeting resistance pathways (e.g., PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors in selected molecular contexts) or mutation-directed TKIs — rationale: address co-alterations or actionable mutations mediating resistance. Recommend trial enrollment whenever feasible.
