## Case

A 63-year-old South Asian female with comorbid DM, HTN, and hypothyroidism presented with left breast lump in July 2024. Initial core biopsy was negative, but FNAC showed proliferative breast disease with atypia. Post-surgical histopathology revealed epithelial myoepithelial neoplasm. IHC showed ER+, PR-, HER2- with Ki-67 7%. Initial PET-CT showed multicentric disease with axillary involvement. Follow-up PET-CT in February 2025 demonstrated disease progression despite first-line hormonal therapy with Letrozole and Palbociclib. NGS testing on the tumor tissue revealed somatic mutations including BRCA2 (VAF 2.61%, 1,683 reads), PIK3CA H1047R (VAF 13.0%, 420 reads), BRIP1 (VAF 9.9%, 384 reads), and TP53 (VAF 4.48%, 960 reads).

### Answer 1

Given this 63-year-old patient's progression on first-line CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, the somatic BRCA2 mutation (VAF 2.61%) does not constitute an indication for PARP inhibitor therapy, as current FDA approvals and guidelines specify germline BRCA mutations for olaparib and talazoparib in the metastatic setting. The OlympiAD and EMBRACA trials, which established PARP inhibitor efficacy in metastatic breast cancer, specifically enrolled patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations, and subsequent studies have not demonstrated equivalent efficacy for somatic BRCA mutations due to lower variant allele frequencies and reduced homologous recombination deficiency. The presence of PIK3CA H1047R mutation (VAF 13.0%) makes this patient an ideal candidate for alpelisib plus fulvestrant, based on the SOLAR-1 trial which demonstrated significant progression-free survival benefit in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, PIK3CA-mutated advanced breast cancer following CDK4/6 inhibitor progression. Alpelisib would be preferred over capivasertib in this setting given the specific PIK3CA mutation and established regulatory approval. The patient's comorbid diabetes mellitus requires careful monitoring given alpelisib's hyperglycemic effects, but does not preclude its use with appropriate glucose management and endocrinologic consultation.

### Answer 2

The PIK3CA H1047R mutation in this patient provides strong evidence for using alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant following progression on CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. The SOLAR-1 trial demonstrated that alpelisib plus fulvestrant significantly improved progression-free survival compared to fulvestrant alone in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients with PIK3CA mutations who progressed on or after CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy (median PFS 11.0 vs 5.7 months, HR 0.65, p<0.001). The BYLIEVE trial further supported this combination, showing a median PFS of 7.3 months in the cohort of patients who received prior CDK4/6 inhibitors, with manageable toxicity profiles. However, the concurrent TP53 mutation (VAF 4.48%) presents a concerning prognostic factor, as TP53 mutations are associated with more aggressive tumor biology, increased genomic instability, and potentially reduced sensitivity to targeted therapies including PI3K inhibitors. While TP53 mutations may confer relative resistance to alpelisib, the SOLAR-1 subgroup analysis suggested that patients with PIK3CA mutations still derive benefit from alpelisib regardless of TP53 status, though the magnitude of benefit may be attenuated. Given this patient's clear PIK3CA H1047R mutation with substantial VAF (13.0%), the alpelisib-fulvestrant combination remains the evidence-based standard of care, though close monitoring for progression and consideration of alternative therapies such as everolimus-based combinations or chemotherapy should be discussed given the TP53 co-mutation and potential for more aggressive disease behavior.

## Q3 (79e1f9a5-08fd-4d31-a010-e01994ee9675)



### Answer 3

The discordance between the initial negative core biopsy and final surgical pathology revealing epithelial myoepithelial neoplasm represents a recognized diagnostic challenge, occurring in approximately 5% of breast cancer cases due to sampling error, tumor heterogeneity, or technical factors during biopsy procurement. Epithelial myoepithelial neoplasms of the breast are exceedingly rare malignancies comprising both epithelial and myoepithelial components, with the myoepithelial component often conferring more aggressive biological behavior and potential for rapid progression. In this 63-year-old patient, the tumor's ER+/PR-/HER2- profile with low Ki-67 (7%) initially suggested an indolent luminal A-like phenotype suitable for first-line CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy with letrozole and palbociclib per NCCN guidelines; however, the early progression by February 2025 likely reflects the aggressive nature of the myoepithelial component overriding the seemingly favorable hormone receptor status. The somatic mutations identified through NGS, particularly PIK3CA H1047R (VAF 13.0%) and TP53 (VAF 4.48%), along with the BRCA2 and BRIP1 mutations, suggest genomic instability and DNA repair defects that may render this tumor more responsive to PARP inhibitors or platinum-based chemotherapy rather than continued hormonal manipulation. Given the rarity of epithelial myoepithelial neoplasms and their unpredictable response to standard endocrine therapy, treatment decisions should prioritize the aggressive myoepithelial biology over the hormone receptor status, considering alpelisib for PIK3CA-mutated disease if performance status permits, or transitioning to chemotherapy with potential incorporation of PARP inhibition given the homologous recombination deficiency suggested by the BRCA2/BRIP1 mutations.
