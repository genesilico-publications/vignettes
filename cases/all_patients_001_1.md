## Case

# Case 1-2015: A 66-Year-Old Woman with Metastatic Breast Cancer after Endocrine Therapy

## Key demographics and history

- Age/sex: 66-year-old woman, postmenopausal (menopause ~53 years)
- Relevant past medical history: gastroesophageal reflux disease, osteopenia, sciatica; history of a stage IA melanoma 3 years before current evaluation, melanoma in situ on right calf 1 year before current evaluation, prior squamous- and basal-cell skin cancers; myomectomy for fibroids.
- Social/family history: former smoker (20 pack-years, quit 23 years earlier), 1–2 alcoholic drinks/week. Family history notable for a paternal aunt with breast cancer at age 70; no known family history of ovarian or colon cancer. No children.
- Medications: multivitamin, vitamin D, calcium.

## Initial breast-cancer presentation and primary treatment (timeline)

- ~6 years before current evaluation: patient noted a palpable mass in the superolateral quadrant of the left breast.
- Imaging: mammography limited by extremely dense breasts; targeted ultrasound identified an irregular hypoechoic mass measuring ~2.0 cm × 1.8 cm × 0.9 cm. Preoperative MRI showed a lobulated, enhancing left-breast mass measuring ~2.5 cm × 2.3 cm with irregular margins.
- Surgery/pathology: lumpectomy with sentinel-lymph-node biopsy and subsequent axillary dissection. Pathology: invasive ductal carcinoma, moderately differentiated (grade 2/3) with associated DCIS (grade 2–3/3). Extensive lymphatic invasion. One sentinel node with macrometastasis and extracapsular extension; remaining 10 axillary nodes negative. Final stage: clinical T2 N1 M0.
- Biomarkers (primary tumor): estrogen receptor (ER)–positive, progesterone receptor (PR) <1% (initially reported as minimally PR-positive), HER2-negative (IHC/FISH negative). The authors designate the tumor as luminal B subtype clinically.
- Adjuvant therapy: adjuvant anthracycline–cyclophosphamide (AC) × 4 cycles, paclitaxel × 4 cycles, adjuvant radiation to left breast and supraclavicular region (total 6000 cGy over ~5 weeks). Adjuvant endocrine therapy with anastrozole was started ~8 months after diagnosis and continued for 5 years; therapy was stopped per guideline at that time.

## Surveillance and detection of recurrent disease

- Surveillance strategy: routine serial imaging with alternating mammography (with tomosynthesis later) and breast MRI every ~6 months.
- Presentation of recurrence: 7 months after completion of 5 years of anastrozole, routine bilateral breast MRI demonstrated two enlarged enhancing left internal mammary lymph nodes (measuring ~1.5 cm × 1.0 cm and 1.8 cm × 1.0 cm). CT chest showed several indeterminate 4–5 mm pulmonary nodules in the right lung. CT A/P showed benign-appearing hepatic cysts. Bone scan negative.
- Biopsy: CT-guided FNA of an internal mammary lymph node demonstrated malignant epithelioid cells cytologically similar to the prior breast carcinoma but with insufficient tissue for full ancillary studies. Thoracoscopic wedge resection of an occult subpleural left lower-lobe nodule (0.8 cm × 0.8 cm × 0.1 cm) was performed; the lung nodule had not been seen on prior imaging and was resected for diagnosis and potential cytoreduction.

## Metastatic pathology and biomarker results

- Histology (lung metastasis): irregular nests of malignant epithelial cells infiltrating lung parenchyma with lymphovascular invasion; morphology consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma.
- Immunohistochemistry on lung metastasis: cytokeratin-positive, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)–negative, napsin A–negative (supporting non-pulmonary origin). Hormone-receptor status on the metastatic specimen: ER-positive, PR-positive, HER2-negative. (Note: PR status showed discordance compared with the original primary tumor, which had PR <1%.)

## Molecular/genomic testing

- Platform: multiplex PCR–based panel (clinical assay able to detect >100 recurrent mutations) performed on the metastatic tumor specimen.
- Result: activating PIK3CA missense mutation (E542K, helical-domain mutation). The NEJM case report and the available text do not report variant allele fraction (VAF) or read depth for the detected PIK3CA mutation; copy-number changes, MSI, and tumor mutation burden (TMB) were not reported.
- Note: the original primary tumor was not retested, so it is unknown whether the PIK3CA E542K mutation was present in the primary tumor or arose in the metastatic clone.

## Staging and disease burden at recurrence

- Sites of metastatic disease: left internal mammary lymph nodes (enlarged and biopsy-positive by cytology) and a small solitary visceral metastasis in the left lower lobe of the lung (0.8 cm, resected). Additional small pulmonary nodules (4–5 mm) in the right lung were reported on CT as indeterminate.
- Disease burden: oligometastatic pattern (isolated intrathoracic disease and internal mammary node involvement) with limited tumor volume and indolent clinical course at presentation (patient asymptomatic).

## Performance status, organ function, and laboratory data

- Performance status: patient reported no disease-related symptoms and wished to preserve quality of life; exam otherwise normal aside from radiation changes to left breast skin. The case implies an ECOG performance status of 0–1.
- Laboratory and organ-function testing at recurrence: complete blood count within normal limits; electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin normal; standard renal and hepatic function tests normal; cancer antigen 15-3 normal.

## Subsequent systemic therapies, responses, toxicities, and course

- Initial systemic management of recurrence: patient opted for medical therapy with the steroidal aromatase inhibitor exemestane as first-line therapy for recurrence (chosen for quality-of-life considerations and asymptomatic disease).
- Response to exemestane: imaging at 4 months showed stable to slightly decreased internal mammary adenopathy. She continued exemestane for a total of 8 months, after which follow-up imaging showed enlargement of the internal mammary nodes, consistent with progression.
- Clinical trial and targeted therapy: after progression on exemestane, the patient enrolled in a trial of the PI3Kα inhibitor BYL719 (alpelisib) combined with fulvestrant (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01219699). BYL719 was discontinued after 1 month because of a drug-related rash. Fulvestrant was continued as single-agent therapy.
- Current disease status at last report in the case: the patient continued on fulvestrant with no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy and stable disease in the lung 2 years after the diagnosis of metastatic disease. She remains interested in participation in additional PIK3CA-targeted clinical trials at progression.

## Clinical issues and relevant comments for precision oncology

- The tumor is hormone-receptor–positive, HER2-negative, and harbors an activating PIK3CA E542K mutation (helical-domain). PIK3CA mutations are common in HR-positive breast cancer and are associated with endocrine resistance and as a biomarker for PI3Kα-directed therapy (e.g., alpelisib).
- The metastatic lesion demonstrates PR expression not seen in the primary specimen, highlighting intratumoral heterogeneity or temporal evolution in receptor expression; biopsy of metastatic sites altered biomarker assessment and facilitated genotyping.
- The case predates routine use of frontline CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy in metastatic HR-positive disease; modern sequencing of therapies may differ from the management described in this historical case.
- VAF/read depth and comprehensive genomic profiling (e.g., NGS panels providing VAF, copy-number, and co-occurring alterations) were not reported in the case; such data would be useful in 2025 for prognostication and trial selection (including ESR1 mutation testing via tissue or ctDNA, BRCA1/2 germline testing, and broader NGS panels).

## Q1 (001_1)

Given this patient’s postmenopausal status, prior 5-year adjuvant anastrozole, and current disease limited to internal mammary nodes and a solitary resected pulmonary metastasis harboring a PIK3CA E542K mutation, what is the most guideline-concordant next systemic treatment option in 2025 assuming she is treatment‑naïve in the metastatic setting (i.e., did not previously receive a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic setting), and why?

### Answer 1

In 2025 the guideline-concordant first-line systemic therapy for a postmenopausal patient with ER+/HER2– advanced breast cancer who completed adjuvant AI >12 months earlier is endocrine therapy combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib, ribociclib, or abemaciclib), provided no contraindication. PIK3CA mutation (E542K) confers sensitivity to PI3Kα inhibitors (alpelisib) when combined with fulvestrant, but SOLAR‑1 primarily enrolled patients without prior CDK4/6 inhibitor exposure, and current sequencing is to use CDK4/6 inhibitors up front then consider PI3Kα inhibition at progression. If contraindications to CDK4/6 inhibitors exist, alpelisib + fulvestrant is an alternative. Rationale: preserved ECOG 0–1, limited disease, desire to preserve quality of life; stronger randomized evidence and guideline consensus support upfront CDK4/6 + endocrine therapy in 1L metastatic setting.

## Q2 (001_2)

The metastatic biopsy shows a PIK3CA E542K (helical-domain) mutation without reported VAF. How does the presence of E542K specifically inform treatment selection and predicted benefit from PI3Kα inhibition compared with wild-type PIK3CA, and what additional molecular information (and how) would you request to refine therapy selection?

### Answer 2

E542K is a canonical activating PIK3CA hotspot mutation (helical domain) that predicts pathway activation and is associated with benefit from PI3Kα-selective inhibitors (alpelisib) plus endocrine therapy, as demonstrated in SOLAR‑1. The absence of VAF limits assessment of clonality; higher VAF suggests a truncal/clonal event and may predict greater dependence on PI3K signaling. Additional testing to request: (1) report of VAF and read depth from the tumor assay or repeating with comprehensive tissue NGS; (2) plasma ctDNA NGS to confirm or quantify mutation and assess heterogeneity; (3) testing for co-occurring alterations (ESR1, PTEN loss, AKT1, FGFR, HER2 amplifications) that affect endocrine sensitivity/PI3K response; (4) germline BRCA1/2 testing per guideline. These data refine selection (e.g., PI3Kα inhibitor candidacy, preference for fulvestrant or SERD if ESR1 mutated, alternate targeted trials if co‑mutations present).

## Q3 (001_3)

The patient experienced a grade ≥2 rash with BYL719/alpelisib in the clinical trial that led to discontinuation of alpelisib after 1 month. According to the FDA label and SOLAR‑1 toxicity profile, what is the recommended approach to management of PI3Kα inhibitor–associated rash and hyperglycemia, and how would these strategies influence rechallenge decisions in this patient?

### Answer 3

PI3Kα inhibitors commonly cause hyperglycemia and cutaneous rash. Management per the PIQRAY (alpelisib) label and SOLAR‑1 practice: baseline fasting glucose and HbA1c; frequent glucose monitoring on therapy; treat hyperglycemia with metformin first-line and insulin for severe cases; hold alpelisib for Grade 3 hyperglycemia and resume at reduced dose when improved. For rash: prophylactic antihistamines are used in some centers; treat mild–moderate rash with topical corticosteroids/antihistamines; for Grade ≥3 or severe cutaneous adverse reactions, interrupt or permanently discontinue according to label. Rechallenge after non–life‑threatening rash is possible with interruption, supportive care and dose reduction; permanent discontinuation is required for severe hypersensitivity. Given the patient's prior intolerance (rash leading to discontinuation), rechallenge would require careful dermatology evaluation and risk–benefit discussion; if rash was severe or hypersensitivity suspected, avoid rechallenge and consider alternative trial agents with different safety profiles.

## Q4 (001_4)

If the metastatic tumor’s PIK3CA mutation had been absent, would exemestane + everolimus remain a guideline-consistent option after progression on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, and how does BOLERO‑2 inform the expected magnitude of benefit and toxicity tradeoffs for this patient profile?

### Answer 4

Yes. Everolimus + exemestane (mTOR inhibition) is an evidence-based option for postmenopausal HR+/HER2– advanced breast cancer after progression on nonsteroidal AIs. BOLERO‑2 showed a median PFS improvement (approx. 4.1 → 11 months) with the addition of everolimus but with increased toxicity including stomatitis, rash, fatigue, infections, and metabolic derangements. Thus, everolimus + exemestane is a reasonable option for patients who can tolerate increased toxicity and seek disease control; the toxicity profile must be discussed and actively managed.

## Q5 (001_5)

The metastatic specimen shows ER positivity with PR now positive (discordant from the original primary with PR <1%). How does receptor status discordance between primary and metastatic lesions affect endocrine-sensitivity predictions, and how should it influence immediate systemic therapy choice in this patient?

### Answer 5

Receptor discordance between primary and metastatic sites is well recognized. Confirmation of ER positivity in the metastatic specimen supports continued endocrine-based therapy as the backbone of treatment rather than immediate cytotoxic chemotherapy in an asymptomatic patient. PR status changes provide additional context but do not alone mandate a change away from endocrine therapy; selection between AI + CDK4/6, fulvestrant-based regimens, or other endocrine strategies depends more on prior endocrine exposure, presence of ESR1 mutation, and performance status. Therefore the metastatic ER positivity supports endocrine therapy (plus CDK4/6 inhibitor in first-line 2025 practice) or fulvestrant if clinical reasons favor it.

## Q6 (001_6)

Should germline BRCA1/2 testing be performed for this patient at the time of metastatic diagnosis in 2025, and what are the implications for systemic therapy and targeted options if a pathogenic germline BRCA variant were found?

### Answer 6

Yes. Current guidelines (ASCO and NCCN expansions) recommend offering germline BRCA1/2 and broader hereditary-cancer gene testing to patients with metastatic breast cancer. A pathogenic germline BRCA1/2 variant would render the patient eligible for PARP inhibitor therapy (e.g., olaparib, talazoparib) for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and has implications for family cascade testing and risk-reduction counseling. PARP inhibitors are an evidence-based targeted option that would alter therapeutic sequencing and trial eligibility.

## Q7 (001_7)

Explain how ESR1 mutation testing (tissue or ctDNA) would change endocrine therapy choices for this patient and which agents/trials (including elacestrant/EMERALD) would be appropriate if an ESR1‑activating mutation were identified.

### Answer 7

ESR1 ligand-binding domain mutations are associated with acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors and favor use of SERDs (fulvestrant or oral SERDs). The EMERALD trial showed improved PFS with the oral SERD elacestrant versus standard endocrine therapy, particularly in patients with ESR1‑mutated tumors previously treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. If an ESR1 mutation is found, fulvestrant or an oral SERD (e.g., elacestrant where approved) would be preferred; trial enrollment of newer SERDs or SERD combinations is appropriate. Testing can be done on tissue or plasma ctDNA; ctDNA is acceptable and may detect heterogeneity.

## Q8 (001_8)

Considering the patient’s oligometastatic pattern (isolated internal mammary nodes and a solitary small pulmonary metastasis, with resection), what is the role of metastasectomy or local therapy in HR+ metastatic breast cancer, and was the thoracoscopic wedge resection consistent with best practice? Cite evidence and describe how local management affects systemic therapy decisions.

### Answer 8

In selected patients with limited, resectable pulmonary metastases and controlled primary disease, pulmonary metastasectomy can be considered for diagnostic confirmation, obtaining tissue for biomarker testing, and occasionally for long-term local control; evidence is retrospective and nonrandomized. The thoracoscopic wedge resection in this patient was appropriate for diagnostic confirmation (provided receptor and genomic data) and potential cytoreduction. Local therapy does not replace systemic therapy for HR+ metastatic disease but informs systemic therapy by providing updated receptor and molecular data that guide endocrine and targeted choices.

## Q9 (001_9)

If the patient’s tumor had a PIK3CA E542K mutation detected only in plasma ctDNA at low VAF and not in tissue, how would you interpret this result with respect to treatment selection for PI3Kα inhibition?

### Answer 9

A PIK3CA hotspot detected in plasma ctDNA is clinically actionable and accepted as a selection biomarker for alpelisib when tissue is unavailable; SOLAR‑1 biomarker analyses support benefit for PIK3CA-mutant disease detected in tumor or plasma. Low VAF suggests a subclonal or low-burden population and raises questions about true driver status, so confirmatory testing (repeat ctDNA or tissue rebiopsy if feasible) is reasonable. If the hotspot is reproducibly detected and called confidently by a validated assay, PI3Kα inhibition can be considered despite low VAF, but expected benefit may be lower if the alteration is subclonal.

## Q10 (001_10)

Propose three clinical trial strategies (mechanism and rationale) that would be appropriate for this patient at the time of progression on fulvestrant in 2025, given her PIK3CA E542K mutation, prior intolerance to alpelisib (rash), and good performance status.

### Answer 10

Three trial strategies: (A) enrollment in trials of next‑generation PI3Kα inhibitors or PI3K degradation agents (e.g., inavolisib or newer PI3Kα-selective agents) with improved safety profiles to target PIK3CA E542K while minimizing rash/hyperglycemia; (B) trials of oral SERDs (or SERD combinations) ± targeted agents (e.g., SERD + CDK4/6 or SERD + PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors) if ESR1 or other resistance mutations are present — rationale: overcome endocrine resistance; (C) trials guided by comprehensive NGS identifying actionable co‑mutations (AKT1, FGFR, HER2 alterations) or antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) active in HR+ disease (e.g., sacituzumab govitecan where applicable) or novel targeted combinations. Rationale: pursue alternative, potentially better‑tolerated pathway inhibitors, overcome endocrine resistance, and apply precision medicine to co‑occurring alterations.
