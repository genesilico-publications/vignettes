## Case

# Case vignette: Acquired resistance to crizotinib from CD74–ROS1 G2032R (derived from NEJM case report)

## Demographics and relevant history
- Age/sex: 48-year-old woman.
- Smoking history: Distant history of light smoking (former light smoker).
- Comorbidities: Not specifically reported; clinical course included progressive fatigue, weight loss, intermittent fevers, hypoxemia, and hypercalcemia.

## Presentation and timeline
- Initial presentation: Progressive dyspnea; malignant right pleural effusion cytology consistent with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.
- Initial molecular testing: No EGFR or KRAS activating mutations detected; ALK rearrangement absent.
- First-line systemic therapy: Carboplatin plus pemetrexed (three cycles), with clinical and radiographic progression.
- Further molecular testing: ROS1 rearrangement identified by break-apart FISH. RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing showed CD74–ROS1 fusion transcripts (major splice form CD74 exon 6–ROS1 exon 34; minor form to exon 35). The major splice form is predicted to be oncogenic.
- Targeted therapy and response: Enrolled on a crizotinib clinical trial (250 mg PO twice daily). Rapid symptomatic improvement within 1 week; dramatic radiographic response at 2 months.
- Acquired resistance: Clinical and radiographic progression 1 month after the 2-month response scan while continuing crizotinib.
- Post-progression biopsy and autopsy: Acquired ROS1 kinase–domain mutation c.6094G→A encoding p.G2032R identified in the resistant biopsy. Autopsy sampling showed G2032R present across all metastatic tumor sites examined and absent in normal liver tissue, indicating a somatic, clonal resistance mutation.

## Radiology and pathology
- Radiology: Pretreatment CT—extensive right lung mass and pleural effusion; post-crizotinib CT—marked reduction; progression CT—recurrent mass and effusion.
- Pathology: Pleural effusion cytology with micropapillary clusters (aggressive lung adenocarcinoma). ROS1 rearrangement by break-apart FISH (separated 3' ROS1 signal).

## Molecular/genomic results
- Fusion: CD74–ROS1 (major splice form CD74 exon 6–ROS1 exon 34) confirmed by RT-PCR/Sanger.
- Acquired mutation: ROS1 p.G2032R (c.6094G>A) detected at progression by Sanger sequencing and present in multiple metastases at autopsy. Variant allele fraction (VAF) and read-depth not reported in the NEJM manuscript.
- Other events: No EGFR or KRAS mutations; no ALK translocation prior to ROS1 testing.

## Biomarkers
- FISH: ROS1 break-apart positive.
- IHC/PD-L1/MSI/TMB: Not reported in the case.

## Prior treatments, responses, and toxicities
- Chemotherapy: Carboplatin + pemetrexed—progression after three cycles.
- Targeted therapy: Crizotinib 250 mg PO BID—rapid response then progression. No detailed crizotinib toxicities reported.

## Performance status and organ function
- Performance status: Not numerically specified; clinically symptomatic at progression (hypoxemia, recurrent effusion, weight loss).
- Organ function: No specific lab values provided; hypercalcemia noted during clinical decline.

## Mechanistic and translational data
- G2032R location and effect: Solvent-front substitution creating steric interference with crizotinib binding; biochemical assays show ~270-fold increase in K_i^app for crizotinib and a threefold reduction in K_m^app for ATP, explaining high-level resistance while preserving ATP binding.
- Clonality: G2032R observed across metastatic sites at autopsy, indicating an early clonal resistance event.

## Clinical implications
- On-target solvent-front resistance (G2032R) explains crizotinib failure; next-generation ROS1 inhibitors (repotrectinib and investigational agents such as NVL-520) have been developed to target solvent-front mutations and are the contemporary options to consider.

## Q1 (014_1)

For this 48-year-old woman with metastatic CD74–ROS1–rearranged lung adenocarcinoma who progressed on crizotinib with a biopsy-confirmed ROS1 G2032R solvent-front mutation, what systemic therapy is currently the evidence-based preferred next-line option, and why?

### Answer 1

Repotrectinib (Augtyro) is the evidence-based preferred next-line systemic therapy for ROS1-rearranged NSCLC after progression on a ROS1 TKI when an on-target solvent-front mutation (G2032R) is present. Repotrectinib demonstrated clinically meaningful responses in the TRIDENT-1 program in ROS1 TKI–pretreated patients, and the FDA approved repotrectinib (Nov 15, 2023) for locally advanced/metastatic ROS1-positive NSCLC, including patients who received prior ROS1 TKIs. The G2032R solvent-front substitution confers high-level resistance to crizotinib via steric interference; repotrectinib was developed to retain activity against many solvent-front resistance mutations and has demonstrated intracranial activity and responses in TKI-pretreated cohorts.

---

## Q2 (014_2)

Is entrectinib or lorlatinib expected to overcome the ROS1 G2032R mutation in this patient, and what evidence supports your recommendation?

### Answer 2

No; entrectinib and lorlatinib are not reliably active against ROS1 G2032R. Structural and biochemical data from the NEJM case show that the solvent-front G2032R substitution sterically blocks binding of crizotinib and impairs binding of multiple early-generation ROS1 inhibitors. Clinical and preclinical reports describe limited or absent activity of entrectinib and lorlatinib against G2032R; therefore they are not preferred options for confirmed G2032R-mediated resistance.

---

## Q3 (014_3)

Based on current FDA labeling and TRIDENT-1 data, would this patient meet indication criteria for repotrectinib and what dosing schedule should be recommended if chosen?

### Answer 3

Yes. FDA approval for repotrectinib (Augtyro) includes adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic ROS1-positive NSCLC and covers patients previously treated with ROS1 TKIs. The recommended initiation dosing per product information is 160 mg orally once daily for 14 days, then escalation to 160 mg orally twice daily (with or without food) as tolerated; dose modifications should follow the full prescribing information for toxicity management.

---

## Q4 (014_4)

Given the autopsy finding that the G2032R mutation was present across multiple metastatic sites and absent in normal liver tissue, how should the treating team interpret clonal architecture when deciding between local ablative therapies versus systemic therapy?

### Answer 4

The presence of a clonal, pervasive G2032R across metastases indicates a systemic, on-target resistance mechanism. Systemic therapy targeting the resistance mutation (e.g., repotrectinib) is the primary approach. Local ablative therapies may be used for palliation or for true oligoprogression when most disease remains controlled, but widespread clonal resistance argues against local therapy as sole management.

---

## Q5 (014_5)

Should PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy be recommended for this patient at this stage, and what clinical data support your answer?

### Answer 5

No. Immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy is not preferred while a targetable on-target resistance mechanism (ROS1 G2032R) exists. Oncogene-driven NSCLC (ROS1 fusions) derives greatest benefit from targeted therapies; single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have limited efficacy in driver-positive NSCLC. Targeted next-generation ROS1 inhibitors should be prioritized; ICI-based regimens may be considered later if targeted options are exhausted or per guideline combinations.

---

## Q6 (014_6)

What testing strategy should be performed at progression (tissue NGS, panel selection, ctDNA), and how should results be interpreted given the absence of VAF/read-depth data in the NEJM report?

### Answer 6

Perform comprehensive tissue-based NGS including ROS1 kinase-domain sequencing (exons 34–42) and a broad cancer gene panel to detect co-alterations and bypass mechanisms; obtain plasma ctDNA NGS in parallel if tissue biopsy is infeasible. Contemporary reports should include VAF and read depth: a high tissue VAF and concordant plasma detection suggest a clonal dominant event favoring systemic targeted therapy; low VAF or absent plasma detection may indicate subclonality, sampling variability, or low tumor fraction and may prompt repeat sampling.

---

## Q7 (014_7)

For this patient's G2032R mutant tumor, which investigational agents or clinical trials (other than repotrectinib) are appropriate to consider, and what is the level of evidence supporting them?

### Answer 7

Investigational agents with activity against solvent-front ROS1 mutations include NVL-520 (ARROS-1 program), taletrectinib and other emerging ROS1-selective inhibitors. The evidence base is early-phase clinical (phase 1/2) data and preclinical biochemical evidence; consideration of clinical trial enrollment is appropriate when available or if repotrectinib is not an option or after progression on repotrectinib.

---

## Q8 (014_8)

Explain the biochemical meaning and clinical implications of the NEJM-reported enzymatic data showing a ~270-fold increase in K_i^app for crizotinib against G2032R and a threefold reduction in K_m^app for ATP.

### Answer 8

A ~270-fold increase in K_i^app indicates markedly reduced inhibitor potency (crizotinib binding) against the mutant kinase, quantitatively explaining clinical resistance. A threefold reduction in K_m^app for ATP indicates increased apparent ATP affinity, potentially enhancing catalytic activity and further reducing effectiveness of ATP-competitive inhibitors. Together these changes support the need for structurally distinct inhibitors that can avoid the solvent-front steric clash (e.g., repotrectinib, NVL-520 in development).

---

## Q9 (014_9)

If this patient had active symptomatic brain metastases at progression, how would intracranial activity of candidate systemic agents influence therapy selection for ROS1 G2032R disease?

### Answer 9

Intracranial activity is a key selection criterion. Repotrectinib and newer ROS1-selective agents were designed to be brain-penetrant and have reported intracranial responses (TRIDENT-1 reports). NVL-520 also was engineered for CNS penetration. For G2032R-driven systemic resistance, choose a ROS1 inhibitor with documented CNS activity when brain metastases are present; local CNS-directed therapy (stereotactic radiosurgery or WBRT) may be used for immediate control when necessary.

## Q10 (014_10)

Given that the NEJM case report did not provide VAF or read-depth for the G2032R mutation, how would quantitative VAF and concordant ctDNA results alter clinical interpretation and management decisions in a contemporary setting?

### Answer 10

Quantitative VAF/read-depth and concordant ctDNA detection inform clonality and tumor fraction. High tissue VAF and detectable plasma VAF support a clonal, dominant resistance mechanism and favor switching to a systemic targeted agent (e.g., repotrectinib). Low tissue VAF or absence in plasma suggests subclonality or low tumor shedding and may prompt repeat biopsy, broader genomic profiling, or consideration of other resistance mechanisms. Serial ctDNA monitoring can guide response and detect emerging resistance.
