# Case 31-2011: A 55-Year-Old Man with Oligometastatic Lung Cancer — Patient-specific clinical vignette

## Key demographics and history
- Age/sex: 55-year-old man
- Smoking history: Never-smoker
- Relevant comorbidities: Hyperlipidemia, depression
- Family history: Brother with kidney cancer; otherwise noncontributory
- Medications: Fenofibrate, sertraline; allergy to codeine

## Presentation and timeline (chronologic)
- ~5 months before presentation: Progressive headaches, then left-sided weakness and gait drift; MRI at outside institution identified a partially cystic mass (~1.5 cm) in the right thalamus/upper midbrain.
- Evaluation at MGH:
  - Neurologic exam: Left-sided facial droop, mild left-sided motor drift, one beat of clonus in left leg; wide-based gait.
  - Labs: Hematocrit 38.4% (slightly low), hemoglobin 13.4 g/dL; otherwise normal CBC, electrolytes, hepatic and renal function as reported.
  - Chest CT: 4.8 × 3.2 cm necrotic mass in the right lower lobe crossing the major fissure; no hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
  - FDG-PET: Intense avidity localized to the RLL mass; no abdominal disease identified.
  - Brain MRI: Rim-enhancing ~2.6–3.0 cm right thalamic lesion with mass effect and a separate 1-cm enhancing lesion in the high medial left frontal lobe (synchronous intracranial metastases).
- Initial management:
  - Dexamethasone started with symptomatic improvement.
  - Multidisciplinary decision: local control of brain disease followed by assessment/resection of the primary lung tumor as part of an aggressive strategy for oligometastatic disease.
  - Whole-brain radiation (35 Gy) with stereotactic boost to the thalamic lesion was administered.
- Systemic therapy and surgery:
  - Three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (carboplatin + paclitaxel) given prior to lung resection.
  - Cervical mediastinoscopy for surgical staging (nodes negative), then right lower lobectomy.
- Pathology after resection:
  - Gross/pathologic: 4.0 cm mass, gland-forming adenocarcinoma with stromal desmoplasia; moderately to poorly differentiated features; no visceral pleural invasion; all examined lymph nodes negative (pT2aN0M1 [synchronous brain mets]); margins negative.
  - Cytology/biopsy from FNA consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

## Molecular and biomarker data
- Tumor genotyping (sequencing) of the resected specimen: EGFR exon 19 deletion — a 15 bp deletion (nucleotide positions G2235 to C2249) corresponding to the canonical E746_A750del sensitizing alteration. The report in the case does not provide variant allele fraction (VAF) or sequencing read depth for this finding.
- At recurrence (described below), genotyping (SNaPshot assay on core-biopsy specimen) demonstrated the original exon 19 deletion (E746_A750del) and an acquired exon 20 point mutation 2369C→T (T790M). The case report does not state VAF or read-depth metrics for T790M either.
- Other biomarkers (PD-L1 IHC, FISH for ALK/ROS1, MET amplification, MSI/TMB) are not reported in the case manuscript.

## Clinical course after surgery
- The patient was treated with erlotinib (a first-generation EGFR-TKI) for approximately 2 years with disease control.
- Nine months after lobectomy (while on erlotinib for ~2 years), surveillance CT showed a 1.3 cm soft-tissue density mass at the lobectomy staple line and multiple new bilateral pulmonary nodules, consistent with metastatic recurrence.
- Genotyping of a core-biopsy specimen at the time of recurrence identified the original sensitizing EGFR exon 19 deletion and an acquired EGFR T790M (2369C→T) mutation associated with resistance to first-generation EGFR-TKIs.

## Performance status and organ function
- Baseline cardiopulmonary reserve was sufficient for thoracotomy and lobectomy (patient proceeded to surgical resection and tolerated surgery);
- Initial laboratory studies and hepatic/renal function were reported as normal; however, exact performance-status score (ECOG) at each time point is not explicitly provided in the manuscript.

## Key clinical impressions (oncology-focused)
- Diagnosis: EGFR-mutant (exon 19 deletion) lung adenocarcinoma presenting with synchronous intracranial oligometastatic disease (two brain metastases).
- Initial multidisciplinary management (local control of brain metastases, systemic platinum-doublet chemotherapy, and definitive resection of the primary lesion with mediastinal staging) was successful in achieving locoregional control and a prolonged response to EGFR-directed therapy (erlotinib).
- Acquired resistance emerged after ~2 years on erlotinib, with radiographic systemic progression and detection of EGFR T790M on repeat biopsy, which is the canonical mechanism in many cases of acquired resistance to first-generation EGFR TKIs.

## Data limitations and unavailable elements
- Variant allele fractions (VAF) and read-depth metrics for the reported EGFR exon 19 deletion and the acquired T790M mutation were not reported in the NEJM case record.
- PD-L1 expression, comprehensive next-generation sequencing (beyond the reported EGFR variants), MET amplification status, ALK/ROS1 status by FISH/NGS, MSI, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) were not reported.
- ECOG performance status and detailed post-progression organ-function testing (LFTs, creatinine at time of recurrence) are not provided in the case text.

## Implications for precision-oncology decision making
- The presence of an EGFR exon 19 deletion identifies the tumor as EGFR-TKI–sensitive; given the initial intracranial disease, the CNS activity of the chosen TKI is critical when selecting therapy.
- The emergence of EGFR T790M at progression on erlotinib is a well-established mechanism of resistance and, based on contemporary evidence (AURA3, regulatory approvals), confers eligibility for third-generation EGFR-TKI therapy with osimertinib, which has demonstrated systemic and CNS activity in T790M-positive disease.
- Lack of VAF/read-depth reporting limits assessment of clonality/allelic burden; in routine practice, presence and quantity of T790M (and parallel testing for gatekeeper/other co-alterations such as MET amplification or histologic transformation) guide trial selection and sequencing of therapy.

## Q1 (012_1)

Given this patient's presentation (EGFR exon 19–mutant adenocarcinoma, two synchronous brain metastases, no mediastinal nodal disease, and adequate cardiopulmonary reserve), was the multidisciplinary decision to pursue definitive local therapy to the brain followed by resection of the primary tumor and mediastinal staging supported by contemporary evidence and guidelines?

### Answer 1

Yes. For selected patients with limited brain metastases (commonly ≤3), controlled extracranial disease, absence of bulky mediastinal nodal involvement (N0–N1), and adequate cardiopulmonary reserve, aggressive local therapy to both intracranial disease (surgical resection and/or stereotactic radiosurgery ± whole-brain radiotherapy) and definitive treatment of the primary lung tumor (including lobectomy with mediastinal staging) can result in prolonged survival in retrospective series. This patient met selection criteria used in reported series (oligometastatic brain disease, resectable primary, negative nodes on staging), and data summarized in the NEJM case and literature (Table 1) support this approach in selected cases.

---

## Q2 (012_2)

For this patient with an EGFR exon 19 deletion (E746_A750del) identified on resection specimen and no initial VAF/read-depth data, what is the biologic and therapeutic significance of the exon 19 deletion for systemic therapy selection and expected sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, including implications for CNS disease control?

### Answer 2

EGFR exon 19 deletions (including E746_A750del) are canonical sensitizing alterations predictive of high response rates to EGFR TKIs (first-, second-, and third-generation). They generally confer better responses and longer PFS compared with some other sensitizing mutations. CNS penetration differs between agents: first-generation TKIs (erlotinib/gefitinib) have limited CNS efficacy relative to osimertinib; FLAURA showed superior intracranial control with osimertinib. VAF/read depth, while helpful for clonality assessment, is not required to determine eligibility for EGFR-targeted therapy.

---

## Q3 (012_3)

After ~2 years of disease control on erlotinib the patient developed radiographic recurrence with biopsy-proven acquired EGFR T790M (2369C→T). What is the recommended standard-of-care systemic therapy for T790M-positive progression on a first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI, and what is the expected magnitude of benefit versus platinum-based chemotherapy based on randomized data?

### Answer 3

Osimertinib 80 mg orally once daily is the recommended standard-of-care for patients with acquired EGFR T790M–positive NSCLC after progression on a first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI. The AURA3 randomized trial showed superior median progression-free survival with osimertinib (10.1 months) versus platinum–pemetrexed chemotherapy (4.4 months) and higher response rates; osimertinib also demonstrates CNS activity and a favorable toxicity profile.

---

## Q4 (012_4)

In this patient a core-biopsy SNaPshot assay detected both the exon 19 deletion and T790M at recurrence. How should the presence or absence of VAF and read-depth data influence clinical interpretation in the context of acquired resistance, and what additional molecular/panels should be considered at progression to guide therapy and trial enrollment?

### Answer 4

A validated positive result for T790M is actionable regardless of reported VAF/read depth, but VAF/read depth can inform tumor fraction, clonality, and the presence of subclonal populations. At progression, comprehensive assessment for other resistance mechanisms is recommended: tissue-based NGS (preferred) or broad plasma NGS to detect MET amplification, HER2 amplification, PIK3CA, BRAF, KRAS, gene fusions (RET/ROS1/ALK), EGFR amplification, and evidence of histologic transformation. Tissue rebiopsy is particularly important when transformation (small-cell) is suspected.

---

## Q5 (012_5)

If tissue rebiopsy is infeasible, what is the sensitivity and recommended interpretation of plasma ctDNA testing for EGFR T790M; and how should a negative plasma result be managed to avoid false-negative misclassification?

### Answer 5

Plasma ctDNA assays have imperfect sensitivity for T790M—reported sensitivities vary (often 60–70% or lower depending on assay, tumor burden, and study). A positive plasma T790M is considered actionable and can be used to start osimertinib. A negative plasma result does not rule out T790M; tissue rebiopsy is recommended when plasma testing is negative and clinical suspicion for T790M remains. Use of high-sensitivity validated assays (digital PCR, BEAMing, NGS) and repeat/plasma volume considerations can affect detection rates.

---

## Q6 (012_6)

Considering this patient’s intracranial disease at diagnosis and subsequent clinical course, how should CNS activity influence selection between first-line osimertinib versus earlier-generation EGFR-TKIs in current practice, and would you recommend upfront osimertinib if this patient presented today?

### Answer 6

Yes. FLAURA data support first-line osimertinib for EGFR-sensitizing mutations because it significantly prolongs median PFS (18.9 months) versus first-generation EGFR-TKIs and provides superior CNS control and delayed CNS progression. For patients with baseline brain metastases, osimertinib is preferred as first-line therapy to maximize intracranial disease control.

---

## Q7 (012_7)

Describe the mechanism by which EGFR T790M confers resistance to first-generation EGFR TKIs and explain why osimertinib retains activity in T790M-positive tumors.

### Answer 7

The T790M gatekeeper substitution increases ATP affinity of the mutant EGFR kinase domain and sterically hinders binding of first-generation reversible EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib), thereby reducing their inhibitory efficacy. Osimertinib is an irreversible third-generation EGFR inhibitor that covalently binds mutant EGFR, including T790M, with greater selectivity versus wild-type EGFR, overcoming the increased ATP affinity and restoring kinase inhibition in T790M-positive tumors.

---

## Q8 (012_8)

If the patient develops progression on osimertinib after initial response for T790M-positive disease, what are the major resistance mechanisms to third‑generation EGFR inhibitors and what tissue or plasma assays would you prioritize to identify actionable next steps or trial options?

### Answer 8

Major resistance mechanisms to osimertinib include tertiary EGFR mutations (e.g., C797S), bypass-track activations (MET amplification, HER2 amplification), small-cell transformation, and gene fusions (RET, NTRK). At progression, prioritize comprehensive tissue-based NGS (for point mutations, copy-number changes, and fusions) and histologic reassessment (IHC for neuroendocrine markers) to identify small‑cell transformation; if tissue is infeasible, use broad plasma NGS (noting plasma cannot detect histologic transformation). Results guide trial selection (MET inhibitors, combination strategies, fusion-targeted therapies, or histology-directed chemotherapy for small-cell transformation).

---

## Q9 (012_9)

How would comorbidities and organ function (baseline normal hepatic and renal function and adequate cardiopulmonary reserve) influence choice and dosing modifications of osimertinib, and what toxicity monitoring is mandated by the label?

### Answer 9

Osimertinib is dosed at 80 mg PO daily for T790M-positive disease; routine dose adjustment is not required for mild-to-moderate renal or hepatic impairment, but severe organ dysfunction requires caution and specialist assessment. Key label-mandated monitoring includes vigilance for interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (stop for suspected cases), QTc prolongation (baseline and periodic ECGs, monitor electrolytes and concomitant QT-prolonging drugs), cardiomyopathy (assess LVEF if clinically indicated), and ocular toxicity (keratitis). Modify or interrupt therapy per severity and label guidance.

---

## Q10 (012_10)

Based on this patient’s clinical timeline (initial local therapy, lobectomy, followed by 2 years of erlotinib then T790M‑mediated progression), formulate an evidence-based sequencing plan including immediate next-line systemic therapy, additional diagnostic tests before initiation, and relevant clinical trials to consider.

### Answer 10

Immediate next-line systemic therapy: start osimertinib 80 mg PO daily for acquired T790M-positive progression (supported by AURA3). Before initiation obtain baseline ECG (QTc), LFTs and renal function, and consider comprehensive NGS (tissue if feasible; plasma if not) to assess for coexisting resistance mechanisms (MET amplification, HER2 amplification, tertiary EGFR mutations) and to establish a molecular baseline. Consider clinical trials targeting MET amplification, EGFR combination strategies (e.g., EGFR TKI + MET inhibitor or antibody combinations), or mutation/fusion-targeted trials based on results. If osimertinib fails, rebiopsy and broad NGS to define next options (C797S-targeted strategies, MET-directed therapy, or histology-directed chemotherapy) are recommended.
