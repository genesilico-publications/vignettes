## Case

# Case vignette — Chronological liquid biopsy in a CDK12‑mutated mCRPC patient

## Demographics and baseline history
- Age/sex: 55‑year‑old man.
- Presentation: PSA 16.56 ng/mL at diagnosis (May 2018). Classified as NCCN high‑risk localized prostate adenocarcinoma.
- Comorbidities: Not explicitly reported in the source; no baseline severe organ dysfunction recorded prior to systemic therapy.

## Chronological clinical course and treatments
- May 2018: Underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Final pathologic stage: pT3b (extraprostatic extension / seminal vesicle involvement as per the manuscript figure legend).
- Post‑op: PSA decline was inadequate → adjuvant external‑beam radiotherapy (total 66 Gy) with concurrent androgen‑deprivation therapy (ADT).
- 2019–2020: PSA remained undetectable for >1 year, then rose to 2.19 ng/mL.
- Nov 2020: Diagnosed with metastatic castration‑resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with PET/CT showing metastases to lung, thoracic vertebra T6, neck and mediastinum.
- First‑line systemic mCRPC therapy: Docetaxel (3 cycles) with minimal PSA response (PSA ~6 ng/mL sustained for ~1 month).

## Molecular and pathology findings
- Tumor sequencing: Whole‑exome sequencing performed on the prostatectomy specimen (2018‑05‑30) identified a somatic CDK12 mutation. The same CDK12 alteration was validated in a lung metastatic tissue specimen and by sequential plasma ctDNA (liquid biopsy).
- ctDNA dynamics: Serial ctDNA testing documented disappearance of the CDK12 mutation during periods of clinical/biochemical response to platinum‑based chemotherapy and reappearance (with increased abundance) during progression and non‑platinum therapy phases. The case report does not provide specific nucleotide change, variant allele frequency (VAF), or read‑depth numbers in the text (VAF/read depth were not reported).

## Immunohistochemistry (primary tumor)
- HE: Glandular architecture with moderate nuclear atypia and prominent nucleoli.
- Ki‑67: <5% (low proliferative index).
- p53: negative (loss of nuclear staining reported by authors).
- PTEN: positive (retained cytoplasmic expression).
- RB1: heterogeneous staining (reported as +/−).

## Treatments after mCRPC diagnosis and responses
- Feb 2021: Liquid biopsy confirmed CDK12 mutation (after poor response to docetaxel). Based on limited efficacy of PARP inhibitors in CDK12‑mutant tumors, the team added cisplatin to chemotherapy (platinum + docetaxel).
  - Response: PSA fell to 0.26 ng/mL after four cycles; ctDNA CDK12 mutation became undetectable concurrently.
  - Toxicity: Hematologic toxicity (white blood cell decrease) necessitated interruption of platinum therapy; switched to abiraterone.
- Aug 2021: While on abiraterone ± apalutamide, PSA rose and ctDNA CDK12 mutation reappeared.
- Rechallenge with platinum (when hematologic recovery allowed): Partial biochemical response (PSA decline), but severe hematologic toxicity on rechallenge (WBC decrease) and severe edema forced discontinuation; again ctDNA CDK12 became undetectable after the platinum exposure.
- Subsequent therapy: PD‑1 inhibitor (single agent) was administered per literature rationale for CDK12 immunogenic phenotype; PSA continued to rise and ctDNA CDK12 abundance increased markedly while on PD‑1 blockade.
- Outcome: Patient died end of 2021 due to cerebral infarction.

## Performance status and organ function
- The report documents treatment‑limiting hematologic toxicity (leucopenia) and severe edema during platinum rechallenge. Baseline organ function prior to systemic therapy (renal/hepatic) is not detailed in the case report.

## Key clinical‑molecular correlations emphasized by the authors
- Periodic disappearance of ctDNA‑detected CDK12 mutation correlated temporally with clinical and biochemical response to platinum therapy (PSA nadirs), suggesting clonal suppression of CDK12‑mutant tumor populations by platinum agents.
- Lack of clinical benefit with single‑agent PD‑1 inhibition in this patient despite the theoretical immunogenicity of CDK12‑altered tumors.

## Limitations in reported molecular data
- The case report confirms a somatic CDK12 mutation (tissue and ctDNA) but does not report the exact nucleotide/protein change, variant allele frequency (VAF), read depth, copy‑number data, MSI or tumor mutational burden (TMB). These missing details limit quantitative interpretation of ctDNA dynamics and eligibility determinations that depend on VAF thresholds or TMB/MSI status.

## Bottom line (clinical message)
- This single‑patient report supports a possible robust anti‑tumor effect of platinum‑based chemotherapy in a CDK12‑mutated mCRPC patient, with dynamic ctDNA testing demonstrating clonal suppression of the CDK12‑mutant population during response. The case also underscores the heterogeneity of responses to PARP inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade in CDK12‑altered prostate cancer and the potential utility of serial ctDNA to guide therapy.

## Q1 (035_1)

Given this patient’s confirmed somatic CDK12 mutation (detected in prostatectomy tissue, metastatic lung tissue, and serial plasma ctDNA) and his clinical course, is single‑agent PD‑1 (anti‑PD‑1) therapy supported by current evidence as the preferred systemic option after platinum failure, and why or why not for this patient?

### Answer 1

No — single‑agent PD‑1 therapy is not supported as the preferred option for this patient based on current evidence and the patient’s observed course. Rationale: CDK12 inactivation defines an immunogenic molecular subset in some series with increased neoantigen burden, suggesting potential benefit from immune checkpoint blockade; however, retrospective clinical series demonstrate heterogenous and often modest clinical benefit to single‑agent PD‑1 in CDK12‑altered mCRPC, and prospective data are lacking. In this specific patient, single‑agent PD‑1 did not produce biochemical or ctDNA responses (rising PSA and increasing CDK12 abundance while on PD‑1), supporting the conclusion that PD‑1 monotherapy is unlikely to be effective here. Clinical decision should therefore favour alternate systemic strategies (including clinical trial options) rather than routine single‑agent PD‑1.

## Q2 (035_2)

For this patient with CDK12 mutation and prior docetaxel, is a platinum‑based chemotherapy rechallenge supported by evidence and how should the potential benefit be balanced against observed hematologic toxicity in this patient?

### Answer 2

Platinum rechallenge can be supported in selected CDK12‑mutated mCRPC patients given retrospective cohort signals and the patient’s prior robust PSA and ctDNA response to platinum; however, toxicity risk (especially cumulative hematologic toxicity) must be carefully weighed and managed. Rationale: Multiple retrospective series suggest increased platinum sensitivity in subsets of DDR‑altered tumors including some CDK12 cases, and the index patient achieved a profound PSA nadir and ctDNA clearance with platinum. The observed severe leukopenia and edema with rechallenge in this patient mandate dose modification, growth‑factor support, or treatment interruption and favor alternative strategies or clinical trial enrollment if organ function or marrow reserve are compromised. Baseline and interval marrow reserve, renal function (for cisplatin), and cumulative doses determine feasibility.

## Q3 (035_3)

Based on PROfound and other PARP‑inhibitor trial data, should olaparib (or another PARP inhibitor) be recommended for this patient solely on the basis of a CDK12 mutation, and what caveats apply?

### Answer 3

No — olaparib is not routinely recommended for CDK12 mutation alone. Rationale: The PROfound trial demonstrated benefit of olaparib in mCRPC patients with deleterious alterations in certain DDR genes, with strongest evidence for BRCA1/2; CDK12 alterations have shown limited and inconsistent responsiveness to PARP inhibitors in retrospective and prospective cohorts. Therefore, CDK12 does not confer the same level of evidence for PARP inhibitor benefit as BRCA1/2 or ATM alterations, and PARP use solely for CDK12 is not guideline‑standard. If a CDK12 mutation co‑occurs with clearly actionable HRR gene loss (e.g., bi‑allelic BRCA2), PARP inhibitors may be appropriate.

## Q4 (035_4)

How should the treating team interpret the repeated disappearance of the CDK12 mutation in ctDNA during platinum‑induced PSA nadirs and its reappearance at progression, and how should this influence clinical monitoring and timing of therapeutic changes for this patient?

### Answer 4

The temporal ctDNA clearance of CDK12 concurrent with platinum response likely represents clonal suppression of CDK12‑mutant tumor populations; reappearance presages biochemical progression. Rationale: The longitudinal ctDNA data in this patient (ctDNA CDK12 undetectable at PSA nadir and reappearing before PSA rise) indicate that serial ctDNA can be a more immediate marker of clonal burden than PSA. Clinical implications: use serial ctDNA (targeted assays tracking the known CDK12 alteration) at baseline and at on‑treatment nadirs to inform duration of platinum exposure and detect early molecular relapse; consider earlier imaging or therapy switch when ctDNA re‑emerges (even if PSA is low) — but decisions must account for assay sensitivity, limit of detection, and missing VAF/read‑depth data in the report.

---

## Q5 (035_5)

What additional molecular testing (specific assays or metrics) would you request for this patient to refine therapeutic options (e.g., PARP inhibitor eligibility, immunotherapy candidacy, trial matching), and why?

### Answer 5

Request comprehensive genomic profiling (tumor tissue and contemporaneous ctDNA) including exact CDK12 variant annotation (nucleotide and predicted protein effect), zygosity (mono‑ vs bi‑allelic), variant allele frequency and read depth, copy‑number profiling, broader HRR gene panel (BRCA1/2, PALB2, ATM, CHEK2), MSI status, and tumor mutational burden (TMB). Rationale: PARP inhibitor eligibility often requires known deleterious alterations in HRR genes and sometimes evidence of biallelic inactivation; immunotherapy candidacy may be informed by MSI‑H/TMB; trial matching may require exact variant annotation and VAF. In this case, the published report lacks VAF/read depth and zygosity data, limiting confident selection for PARP inhibitors or for trials that require documented biallelic loss.

## Q6 (035_6)

Given the patient’s low Ki‑67 (<5%), heterogeneous RB1 staining and p53 loss on primary tumor IHC, how should this histopathology be weighed when considering a neuroendocrine or treatment‑emergent small‑cell variant and its impact on systemic therapy selection?

### Answer 6

Low Ki‑67 argues against a highly proliferative neuroendocrine/small‑cell phenotype at the time of primary diagnosis, but p53 loss and heterogeneous RB1 raise concern for potential later lineage plasticity; clinical and radiographic features plus serial biomarkers (including neuroendocrine markers if clinically suspected) should guide therapy. Rationale: Treatment‑emergent small‑cell/neuroendocrine prostate cancer often demonstrates high Ki‑67 and concurrent RB1 and TP53 loss; this patient’s low Ki‑67 suggests adenocarcinoma biology initially, but the molecular IHC signals (p53 loss, heterogeneous RB1) mean vigilance is required during progression as phenotype can evolve and would favor platinum‑containing regimens if small‑cell transformation occurs.

## Q7 (035_7)

If the patient’s renal function had become marginal (e.g., creatinine clearance 40–50 mL/min) during recovery from hematologic toxicity, how would that change the choice between cisplatin and carboplatin for further platinum therapy, and what dose adjustments/support measures would you recommend?

### Answer 7

In the setting of reduced renal function (CrCl ~40–50 mL/min), carboplatin is preferred over cisplatin due to lower nephrotoxicity and easier dosing adjustment using the Calvert formula; dose reduction and close hematologic monitoring are required. Rationale: Cisplatin is more nephrotoxic and requires adequate hydration and higher renal reserve; carboplatin AUC dosing (and potential dose reductions) is widely used in mCRPC when platinum is indicated but renal function or performance status limit cisplatin. Given the patient’s prior severe leukopenia on cisplatin, if platinum therapy is reattempted consider carboplatin at reduced AUC, prophylactic G‑CSF, transfusion support as indicated, and interdisciplinary discussion.

## Q8 (035_8)

Which contemporary clinical trials or trial types would be reasonable to consider for this patient given his CDK12 mutation, prior platinum response, and intolerance to further cytotoxic therapy?

### Answer 8

Reasonable options include trials of combination ICI plus targeted agents (to overcome resistance), bispecific T‑cell engager trials targeting prostate antigens, novel DDR combinations (e.g., PARP inhibitor plus ATR/CHK1 inhibitors if biologically rational), and adoptive cellular therapy or vaccine trials that enroll CDK12‑altered or high‑neoantigen prostate cancer. Rationale: Because CDK12 alterations can confer increased neoantigens but single‑agent PD‑1 often fails, combination immunotherapy trials (e.g., PD‑1 plus CTLA‑4 or PD‑1 plus targeted agents) or trials targeting the specific altered pathways may be more promising; trial eligibility typically requires exact molecular annotation. Patient’s prior platinum sensitivity could qualify him for trials selecting for platinum‑sensitive cohorts.

## Q9 (035_9)

How should the treating team integrate the lack of reported VAF and read‑depth for the CDK12 variant in the published case when using the patient’s ctDNA results to guide therapy decisions?

### Answer 9

The absence of VAF and read‑depth limits quantitative interpretation of ctDNA dynamics and the assay’s limit of detection; decisions should therefore incorporate assay characteristics (sensitivity, tissue concordance), repeat testing to confirm clearance or reappearance, and correlation with PSA and imaging before a major therapy change. Rationale: VAF magnitude and read depth determine whether an apparent "clearance" represents true eradication of the clone or simply fall below assay detection; repeated concordant negative tests (or orthogonal tissue confirmation) increase confidence. In this patient, the synchronous PSA nadir and clinical improvement alongside ctDNA clearance increase confidence in true response, but the published absence of numeric assay metrics should prompt clinicians to obtain assay reports with VAF/read depth for real‑world decision making.

## Q10 (035_10)

What is the most evidence‑based next step in systemic therapy for this patient if he presents today with re‑emergent CDK12 mutation on ctDNA, rising PSA, ECOG performance status 1, adequate renal/liver function but persistent grade 3 neutropenia after prior platinum exposure?

### Answer 10

The most evidence‑based approach is to prioritize clinical trial enrollment (especially trials for CDK12‑altered or DDR‑deficient prostate cancer) or to use non‑platinum systemic options (e.g., switch to AR‑axis agents if not exhausted or consider cabazitaxel if prior taxane exposure allowed and marrow reserve can be supported) while addressing hematologic toxicity with growth‑factor support or dose‑modified chemotherapy; routine use of single‑agent PD‑1 or PARP inhibitor for CDK12 alone is not strongly supported. Rationale: Given the patient’s prior platinum benefit but current persistent grade 3 neutropenia, repeating platinum poses high safety risk. Trials combining immunotherapy with targeted agents or novel DDR agents may offer best risk/benefit; if trial access is not possible and AR‑directed therapy remains a viable option, consider that, or consider cabazitaxel with prophylactic G‑CSF and dose adjustments if marrow toxicity can be managed.
