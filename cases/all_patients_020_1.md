## Case

# Case vignette: RET‑fusion positive metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (derived from Targeted Oncology roundtable)

Patient demographics and relevant history

- Age/sex: 59‑year‑old man.
- Smoking history: Never‑smoker.
- Medical history: Type 2 diabetes mellitus, medically controlled. No other comorbidities documented.
- Baseline functional status: ECOG performance status 1.
- Baseline labs and organ function: Reported as within normal limits in the source document (no specific numeric values provided).

Clinical presentation and timeline

- Presenting symptoms: Dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, anorexia, 5‑lb weight loss.
- Imaging at presentation: Chest imaging demonstrated two right lower lobe masses measuring approximately 4.7 cm and 7.4 cm; PET scan with FDG‑avid activity in the right lower lobe masses.
- Central nervous system staging: MRI brain showed three small lesions consistent with brain metastases. Patient had no neurologic symptoms attributable to brain lesions.
- Tissue diagnosis: Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy from the right lower lobe confirmed lung adenocarcinoma.

Pathology and biomarker data

- Histology: Lung adenocarcinoma (transbronchial biopsy).
- PD‑L1 (IHC): 80% tumor proportion score (reported in the transcript).
- Other IHC/FISH: Standard reflex testing included PD‑L1, ALK, and EGFR. No ALK/ROS1/BRAF etc. detected on NGS.

Molecular/genomic testing

- NGS panel result: Negative for ALK, EGFR, ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, NTRK, MET; positive for a KIF5B‑RET fusion.
- VAF / read depth / copy number / MSI / TMB: Not reported in the source document.

Prior treatments and immediate treatment considerations

- Prior systemic therapy: None prior to diagnosis (treatment‑naïve metastatic disease).
- CNS management: Brain metastases are small and asymptomatic; transcript discussion favored waiting for molecular results and initiating RET‑directed TKI once RET fusion was identified.

Therapeutic options discussed

- Selective RET inhibitors: Selpercatinib (RETEVMO) and pralsetinib (GAVRETO) discussed as first‑line options.
- Efficacy evidence: LIBRETTO‑001 (selpercatinib) and ARROW (pralsetinib) showed high systemic and intracranial response rates.

Safety considerations

- Selpercatinib toxicities: hypertension, hepatotoxicity, QT prolongation, hypersensitivity; monitoring recommended per label.
- Pralsetinib toxicities: ILD/pneumonitis, dose interruptions/reductions common; fasting required for dosing.

Resistance mechanisms and subsequent management concepts

- On‑target resistance: RET solvent‑front mutations (eg, G810 substitutions) and other RET kinase domain mutations reported after selective RET inhibitor exposure.
- Off‑target mechanisms: MET amplification and bypass pathway activation reported; next‑generation RET inhibitors (eg, TPX‑0046) are in development for solvent‑front resistance.

Gaps in the record

- No numeric organ function values, VAF, read depth, TMB, or MSI provided in the transcript; these would be important for some trial eligibilities and for serial plasma monitoring.

## Q1 (020_1)

For this 59‑year‑old man with newly diagnosed metastatic KIF5B‑RET fusion lung adenocarcinoma and three small asymptomatic brain metastases, should a selective RET inhibitor be initiated as first‑line systemic therapy, or should local CNS radiotherapy be performed first? Provide a patient‑specific recommendation and rationale.

### Answer 1

Initiate a selective RET inhibitor (selpercatinib or pralsetinib) as first‑line systemic therapy and defer local CNS radiotherapy provided the brain lesions remain asymptomatic and the patient can be closely followed. Rationale: LIBRETTO‑001 and ARROW demonstrated high intracranial and systemic response rates with selective RET inhibitors and clinical guidelines recommend RET‑directed TKIs as first‑line therapy for RET fusion–positive metastatic NSCLC; local therapy reserved for symptomatic, large, or imminently threatening lesions.

---

## Q2 (020_2)

The patient’s tumor expresses PD‑L1 TPS 80%. Should you use pembrolizumab monotherapy, chemo‑immunotherapy, or avoid immunotherapy in favor of targeted therapy? Provide evidence‑based reasoning specific to RET‑fusion NSCLC.

### Answer 2

Avoid immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy as first‑line therapy despite high PD‑L1; prioritize RET‑directed TKI. Observational studies and meta‑analyses demonstrate low ICI response rates in RET fusion–positive NSCLC, and targeted RET inhibitors have substantially higher efficacy. Prior ICI exposure may also increase certain toxicities when followed by RET TKIs.

---

## Q3 (020_3)

Between selpercatinib and pralsetinib, which agent would you preferentially choose first for this patient and what patient‑specific factors should influence this decision (including dosing and toxicity tradeoffs)?

### Answer 3

Either selpercatinib or pralsetinib is guideline‑appropriate; choice should be individualized. Selpercatinib has more mature intracranial data and is dosed twice daily (attention to QT and CYP3A interactions). Pralsetinib is once daily (400 mg) taken on an empty stomach but carries a notable ILD/pneumonitis signal and frequent dose modifications. In this patient with asymptomatic brain mets, selpercatinib’s intracranial evidence may favor selection; consider comorbidities, concomitant medications, QT risk, and patient preference.

---

## Q4 (020_4)

If selpercatinib is started, what baseline monitoring and early surveillance (labs, ECGs, imaging cadence) do you recommend given the patient’s controlled diabetes and the drug’s safety profile?

### Answer 4

Baseline ECG (and periodic ECG monitoring) for QT risk, baseline and serial LFTs for hepatotoxicity, blood pressure monitoring for hypertension, baseline thyroid function as per label, and regular clinical assessments for dyspnea (ILD/pneumonitis). Imaging: radiographic restaging at ~6–8 weeks after initiation (or earlier if clinically indicated) with brain MRI as indicated. Monitor renal function and consider more frequent monitoring if comorbidities or concomitant meds require it.

---

## Q5 (020_5)

Describe the principal mechanisms of acquired resistance to selpercatinib/pralsetinib and propose a practical molecular evaluation and treatment algorithm if this patient progresses on a selective RET inhibitor.

### Answer 5

Principal on‑target mechanism: RET kinase domain substitutions at the solvent front (eg, G810 variants) and other RET mutations. Off‑target mechanisms: MET amplification and other bypass activations. Evaluation: obtain tissue biopsy when feasible (or plasma NGS if unsafe) with assays capable of detecting RET kinase mutations and copy‑number changes; report VAF and read depth. Treatment: for on‑target solvent‑front mutants consider clinical trials of next‑generation RET inhibitors (eg, TPX‑0046) or alternative investigational agents; for bypass mechanisms (eg, MET amplification) consider targeted therapy against the bypass or combination strategies and clinical trial enrollment.

---

## Q6 (020_6)

How does absence of baseline VAF/read‑depth/TMB/MSI data affect interpretation and management for this patient, and when would you specifically request quantitative genomic metrics?

### Answer 6

Absence of VAF/read depth limits assessment of clonality and the sensitivity for subclonal variants; however, a clear actionable driver fusion (KIF5B‑RET) is sufficient to proceed with RET TKI. Quantitative metrics should be requested at baseline if planning serial plasma monitoring, for future resistance surveillance, and at progression to detect low‑VAF resistance clones and to interpret ctDNA dynamics.

---

## Q7 (020_7)

If after 14 months on selpercatinib the patient develops a new liver lesion and plasma ctDNA shows RET G810A at VAF 6% with read depth 5000, how should this be interpreted and what are the immediate management steps?

### Answer 7

Interpretation: a RET G810A at VAF 6% with high read depth is strong evidence of emerging on‑target solvent‑front resistance. Management: pursue tissue biopsy of the progressing lesion when feasible to confirm resistance and assess for coexisting mechanisms (eg, MET amplification); consider trial enrollment with next‑generation RET inhibitors active against G810 (eg, TPX‑0046) or other investigational agents; if trial access unavailable and patient is clinically stable, continuation of selpercatinib for symptom control and rapid trial search is reasonable, with chemotherapy reserved for rapid clinical decline.

---

## Q8 (020_8)

Are there important drug–drug or drug–food interactions or dosing instructions for selpercatinib or pralsetinib that should affect agent selection or patient counseling in a patient with diabetes?

### Answer 8

Yes. Pralsetinib requires fasting (empty‑stomach dosing) which may complicate timing with other oral medications. Selpercatinib requires attention to strong CYP3A inhibitors/inducers and has QT prolongation risk (avoid concomitant QT‑prolonging drugs). Review antihypertensives and glucose medications for interactions and counsel on fasting requirements (pralsetinib) and symptom reporting for ILD or cardiac symptoms.

---

## Q9 (020_9)

Should baseline plasma (ctDNA) testing be obtained in addition to tissue NGS for this patient, and how would baseline plasma findings alter management?

### Answer 9

Yes—baseline plasma NGS is recommended as a complementary test. Plasma can be faster and useful when tissue is limited, and it provides a baseline for future serial monitoring; however, a negative plasma does not exclude fusions. In this patient, tissue already identified KIF5B‑RET, so plasma is complementary for monitoring and future resistance detection rather than necessary for initial treatment selection.

---

## Q10 (020_10)

List three registrational or phase 1/2 trials (baseline or progression) appropriate for this patient, including the agent, mechanism, and rationale for selection (including an option for solvent‑front resistance).

### Answer 10

Examples: (1) LIBRETTO‑001 (selpercatinib; selective RET inhibitor) — registrational program and standard option for RET fusion–positive NSCLC; (2) ARROW (pralsetinib; selective RET inhibitor) — registrational program and standard option; (3) TPX‑0046 SWORD (TPX‑0046; next‑generation RET/SRC inhibitor) — early‑phase trial for patients with solvent‑front (eg, G810) RET resistance and TKI‑resistant RET alterations. Rationale: first two are approved/registrational with high response rates; TPX‑0046 targets solvent‑front resistance observed after first‑generation selective RET inhibitors.
