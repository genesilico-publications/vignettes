# Case vignette: Castration-resistant prostate adenocarcinoma with whole‑genome doubling and CDK12 frameshift (NEJM_case_029)

Summary (concise chronology and key data)

- Demographics and baseline
  - Patient: 54‑year‑old man at initial presentation. No remarkable past medical or family history reported.
  - Presentation: Markedly elevated serum prostate‑specific antigen (PSA) 573.9 ng/mL.
  - Initial pathology: Transrectal prostate biopsy positive in 9/10 cores; Gleason score 4 + 5 (grade group 5).
  - Clinical stage at diagnosis: cT3bN1M1b (prostatic tumor extending beyond capsule with seminal vesicle invasion, nodal and bone metastases).

- Initial systemic therapy and early disease course
  - Androgen‑deprivation therapy (ADT): LHRH agonist in combination with antiandrogens (bicalutamide, flutamide) and ethinylestradiol as first‑line therapy.
  - PSA response: Nadir PSA 0.02 ng/mL after 19 months.
  - PSA relapse at 31 months; PSA maintained <2.0 ng/mL while on ethinylestradiol for 27 months, then progressive rise to >10 ng/mL by 93 months with expansion of pelvic bone metastasis.

- Sequential therapies and oncologic events (chronological)
  - 2nd line: Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 — PSA decreased to 1.70 ng/mL after 6 cycles, but subsequent radiographic progression with new pelvic bone lesions and a lung metastasis.
  - 3rd line: Enzalutamide — treatment stopped after 7 months for lack of PSA response.
  - 4th line: Cabazitaxel (CBZ) 25 mg/m2 — initial PSA decrease to 4.86 ng/mL then PSA relapse after 4 months.
  - Radium‑223 (Ra‑223) added (6 courses) combined with cabazitaxel (10 cycles reported in timeline images) with limited disease control by bone scan.
  - Subsequent local therapy: External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to pelvic bone metastasis (37.5 Gy/15 fractions) produced marked radiographic and PSA responses.
  - 5th line: Abiraterone — produced PSA decline from 81.77 to 19.9 ng/mL, followed by progression after ~6 months with new vertebral metastases (L4/5) and rising neuron‑specific enolase (NSE) to 30.9 ng/mL (raised concern for neuroendocrine differentiation).
  - 6th line: Platinum‑doublet chemotherapy (cisplatin 80% dose + etoposide 100% dose) with radiation to multiple vertebral/pelvic sites — PSA/NSE decreased transiently; progression resumed 11 months later.
  - 7th–8th lines: Additional cycles of cabazitaxel (4 cycles) and carboplatin (CBDCA) + irinotecan (CPT‑11) (4 cycles) with further progression of nodal disease.
  - 9th line: Repeat CBZ; shortly after re‑initiation patient developed acute bilateral leg weakness due to epidural cord compression from L4/L5 metastases.
  - Emergency spinal decompression surgery was performed with neurologic recovery; resected bone metastasis again showed adenocarcinoma positive for PSA and AR.
  - Post‑op: CBZ resumed (4 cycles) with PSA stabilizing at ~100 ng/mL.
  - 10th line (contemporaneous with molecular workup): Carboplatin + irinotecan continued while genomic testing performed.

- Radiology and pathology
  - Imaging: MRI showed initial prostate tumor invading right seminal vesicle; serial imaging documented shrinkage with ADT/chemotherapy, later multifocal bone progression including epidural extension causing cord compression; CT showed progressive nodal disease and a pulmonary metastasis.
  - Bone scans: Initial pelvic uptake, incomplete response to Ra‑223; EBRT produced marked improvement.
  - Histology: Biopsy of right inguinal lymph node and resected lumbar vertebral metastasis both showed adenocarcinoma morphology (H.E.) with large, polymorphic nuclei in metastasis (consistent with ploidy aberration).
  - Immunohistochemistry (IHC): Strong diffuse PSA cytoplasmic positivity and nuclear androgen receptor (AR) positivity in both metastatic sites; chromogranin and synaptophysin negative (neuroendocrine markers negative despite transient NSE rise).

- Genomic and biomarker findings (from tumor‑normal paired WES — PleSSision Exome)
  - Somatic single‑nucleotide variants reported: CDK12 p.G101Dfs*23 (frameshift), FOXA1 p.R261C, MACC1 p.M480L, and HIP1 p.Q265E.
  - Copy‑number alterations: Extensive genome‑wide copy gains; amplifications noted in 85 driver genes including CDK12. Representative chromosome‑level total copy numbers (from figure): chr1 CN=6 (UPD), chr2 CN=4 (UPD), chr3 CN=3, chr4 CN=4, chr14 CN=6, chr16 CN=8, chr17 CN=6, chrX CN=8, etc.
  - Whole‑genome doubling (WGD): Global CN gains across virtually all autosomes with major‑allele ploidy shifts and VAF clusters at ~25% and ~75% consistent with tumor tetraploidy/WGD.
  - Tumor mutational burden (TMB): Authors report 155 somatic non‑synonymous SNVs by their WES pipeline (their threshold: ≥150 = likely hypermutated); this corresponds to a relatively high count by their definition but does not include a mut/Mb conversion in the paper.
  - Microsatellite instability (MSI): Negative.
  - Not detected: No mutation or amplification in AR, TP53, PTEN, SPOP, MYC, or PI3K/WNT pathway genes; DNA repair genes other than CDK12 had no notable alterations reported.
  - Variant allele frequency (VAF) pattern: Genome‑wide VAF clustering at ~25% and ~75% (figure 4), supporting tetraploidy; per‑variant VAF/read‑depths were not individually tabulated in the manuscript text.

- Performance status and organ function
  - Throughout most of the post‑CRPC course the patient maintained a generally good performance status and survived >13 years from diagnosis with multimodal therapy. No explicit numeric ECOG PS or laboratory organ‑function values are provided in the manuscript; text describes "generally good performance status."

- Clinical course/outcome
  - Long survival (~13 years) after initial therapy despite repeated systemic progression; disease remained AR‑driven adenocarcinoma by IHC despite transient biochemical suspicion for neuroendocrine transformation. WGD and CDK12 mutation were identified late in the course after extensive prior therapy.

Interpretative summary for clinicians

- This is a case of long‑surviving metastatic castration‑resistant prostate adenocarcinoma that developed whole‑genome doubling and harbors a somatic frameshift CDK12 mutation (p.G101Dfs*23) together with widespread copy‑number gains and a relatively high somatic non‑synonymous SNV count (155 by the reporting pipeline). MSI was negative.
- Clinical implications: WGD is associated with genomic complexity and can complicate variant interpretation (VAFs reflect shifted ploidy). CDK12‑altered prostate cancers form a molecular subgroup reported to have increased neoantigen burden and possible immunogenicity but heterogeneous clinical responses to immune checkpoint blockade; evidence for PARP‑inhibitor sensitivity in CDK12‑mutant prostate cancer is limited compared with BRCA1/2‑ or ATM‑altered tumors.

## Q1 (029_1)

Given the tumor's sequencing result showing a somatic frameshift CDK12 mutation (p.G101Dfs*23) together with copy‑number gains across the genome (including reported amplification of CDK12), does this data constitute definitive biallelic loss of CDK12 in this patient, and what additional genomic information would you need to confirm biallelic inactivation?

### Answer 1

The available data do not definitively establish biallelic loss of CDK12. A single truncating somatic frameshift plus copy‑number gains can reflect monoallelic truncation with amplification of either the wild‑type or mutant allele, or true biallelic loss if the second allele has been deleted or otherwise inactivated. To confirm biallelic inactivation you need: (a) allele‑specific copy‑number analysis at the CDK12 locus to assess loss of the wild‑type allele or copy‑neutral LOH; (b) targeted search for a second somatic or germline truncating variant or structural event (including focal homozygous deletion); (c) assessment of tumor purity and ploidy and read‑level phasing if possible; and (d) review of matched normal (germline) data. Absent these data, record as “CDK12 truncating — biallelic status unconfirmed.”

## Q2 (029_2)

Based on the patient’s tumor profile (CDK12 frameshift, WGD, 155 non‑synonymous somatic SNVs by the authors' WES counts, MSI‑negative), is this patient currently a guideline‑supported candidate for a PARP inhibitor (e.g., olaparib), and how should you counsel about expected likelihood of benefit?

### Answer 2

Current evidence and approvals support PARP inhibitor use primarily for tumors with deleterious alterations in key HRR genes (notably BRCA1/2 and certain others) as per randomized PROfound data. CDK12 truncating alterations are not established biomarkers of PARP‑inhibitor sensitivity at the same evidence level as BRCA1/2. Retrospective series show heterogeneous and generally lower response rates to PARP inhibitors in CDK12‑altered mCRPC. Therefore, PARP inhibitor therapy is not a guideline‑level standard for CDK12 alteration alone; consider only within clinical trials or after confirmatory evidence of biallelic HRR loss. Counsel the patient that expected benefit is uncertain and likely lower than for BRCA1/2‑mutant tumors.

---

## Q3 (029_3)

Does the reported tumor mutational profile make the patient eligible for PD‑1 inhibitor therapy (pembrolizumab) on the basis of tumor mutational burden (TMB) or microsatellite instability (MSI), and how would you estimate TMB from the provided WES result?

### Answer 3

MSI is negative, so MSI‑high indication is absent. The authors report 155 somatic non‑synonymous SNVs but do not provide mut/Mb. Converting to mut/Mb requires the callable coding territory (commonly ~30–50 Mb); using ~30–35 Mb, 155 nonsynonymous SNVs corresponds to roughly ~4–5 mut/Mb, below the FDA TMB‑high threshold of ≥10 mut/Mb. Therefore, by standard criteria this tumor would not meet TMB‑high. CDK12 tumors can be immunogenic via fusion neoantigens, but pembrolizumab indication based solely on TMB/MSI is not supported here unless the lab‑validated assay reports ≥10 mut/Mb.

---

## Q4 (029_4)

How does whole‑genome doubling (WGD), as seen in this patient (global CN gains and VAF clusters at ~25% and ~75%), affect interpretation of variant allele frequencies, copy‑number calls, and the reliability of single‑sample tumor‑only biomarker calls (e.g., homozygous deletion calls, VAF‑based LOH inference)? How should the laboratory/tumor board approach variant interpretation in this context?

### Answer 4

WGD alters baseline allele copy numbers: tetraploid genomes shift expected VAFs (clonal heterozygous mutations can appear near 25% or 75% depending on allele‑specific copy number and tumor purity). VAFs cannot be interpreted without purity and ploidy correction; single‑sample tumor‑only assays are prone to misclassify zygosity in WGD contexts. The lab should use tumor‑normal matched sequencing, perform purity/ploidy estimation, allele‑specific copy‑number segmentation, and integrate copy number with VAFs to call biallelic events. Reports should explicitly state WGD and provide allele‑specific copy number at loci of interest; multidisciplinary review is recommended.

## Q5 (029_5)

For this patient with metastatic AR‑positive adenocarcinoma and CDK12 truncation, after progression on multiple standard therapies (including taxanes, AR‑pathway inhibitors, platinum doublets and radium‑223), what clinical trial modalities would be highest priority to discuss (mechanistic match), and why?

### Answer 5

Priority trials: (a) immune checkpoint inhibitor trials or combinations (PD‑1/PD‑L1 ± CTLA‑4/other immunomodulators) targeting CDK12‑altered mCRPC because CDK12 inactivation is associated with fusion neoantigens and immunogenic phenotype; (b) PARP inhibitor combination trials (PARP+IO or PARP+other agents) given genomic instability though single‑agent PARP efficacy is unclear for CDK12; (c) trials targeting transcriptional CDKs or cell‑cycle regulators or basket trials accepting CDK12 alterations. Rationale: mechanistic immunogenicity and genomic instability in CDK12 tumors justify trial priority.

---

## Q6 (029_6)

Would you recommend germline (hereditary) testing for this patient at this stage, and what are the implications of finding a germline CDK12 variant versus a purely somatic alteration?

### Answer 6

Yes. Guidelines recommend germline testing for men with metastatic prostate cancer. Finding a pathogenic germline CDK12 variant would have familial implications (cascade testing), affect counseling and potentially trial eligibility; germline plus somatic biallelic loss would support a constitutive HRR deficit. However, penetrance and management implications for germline CDK12 are less well‑defined than for BRCA1/2 and require genetic counseling.

---

## Q7 (029_7)

If the patient develops rapid visceral progression (new liver metastases) with rising PSA and maintained ECOG 0–1, how would you prioritize systemic therapy options given his prior lines and molecular profile?

### Answer 7

For visceral‑dominant progression with good performance status and exhausted standard options, priorities are: (1) systemic chemotherapy (cabazitaxel if not exhausted or feasible); (2) clinical trial enrollment (PD‑1/PD‑L1 combinations, PARP±IO) given CDK12 biology; (3) consider olaparib only if confirmatory testing demonstrates qualifying BRCA1/2 or other HRR alterations per PROfound; (4) organ‑directed RT for symptom control as needed. Single‑agent PD‑1 or off‑label PARP based on CDK12 alone is not standard.

---

## Q8 (029_8)

Describe the mechanistic basis by which CDK12 inactivation is hypothesized to create an immunogenic tumor microenvironment, and relate this to the patient's WES finding of numerous somatic events and fusion potential.

### Answer 8

CDK12 loss disrupts transcriptional regulation of long DNA‑repair genes, promoting tandem duplications and structural rearrangements that generate gene fusions producing neoantigenic peptides. These neoantigens can increase intratumoral T‑cell infiltration and immunogenicity. In this patient, extensive copy‑number abnormalities/WGD and elevated somatic event counts are compatible with structural variation and potential fusion neoantigens, providing a rationale for immunotherapy trial consideration despite MSI negativity.

---

## Q9 (029_9)

The WES figure shows VAF clusters at ~25% and ~75% across chromosomes. Explain what tumor purity and clonality assumptions lead to these VAF clusters in the setting of whole‑genome doubling (tetraploidy), and how you would computationally determine whether a specific truncating mutation is clonal.

### Answer 9

In a tetraploid tumor, a clonal heterozygous mutation present on one of four chromatids yields VAF ≈25% (1/4); presence on three of four copies yields VAF ≈75% (3/4). Observed VAFs are diluted by normal cell admixture (tumor purity). To determine clonality: estimate tumor purity and ploidy via allele‑specific segmentation; correct observed VAF for local copy number and purity to compute cancer cell fraction (CCF); cluster CCFs to assign clonal vs subclonal status. For the CDK12 frameshift, compute local copy number, purity, and VAF/read depth to infer clonality.

## Q10 (029_10)

Provide a short, evidence‑based recommendation plan (next 3 steps) for this patient’s multidisciplinary team that integrates his clinical status, the molecular results (CDK12 frameshift, WGD, MSI‑negative, elevated non‑synonymous SNV count), prior therapies and the current guideline environment.

### Answer 10

Recommended next 3 steps: (1) Confirmatory molecular characterization: allele‑specific copy‑number at CDK12, compute mut/Mb with validated assay, and germline testing with counseling; (2) Clinical‑trial referral prioritized for CDK12‑altered mCRPC (PD‑1/PD‑L1 ± combinations, PARP+IO or other combinations); (3) Symptom/locoregional control and evidence‑based systemic sequencing (e.g., cabazitaxel if appropriate) while awaiting trial availability; avoid routine single‑agent PD‑1 or off‑label PARP therapy based solely on CDK12 without confirmatory biomarkers.
