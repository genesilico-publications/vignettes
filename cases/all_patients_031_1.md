## Case

# Case vignette: gBRCA2‑mutated poorly differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (PDNEC) — derived from NEJM/npj case report

## Patient demographics and relevant history
- Age/sex: 66-year-old male.
- Past medical history: unremarkable.
- Family history: mother with carcinoma of unknown primary at 60; father with prostate cancer at 85; brother with lung cancer at 68.

## Presentation and timeline
- Presentation: short history of escalating abdominal pain, distension, nausea, fatigue; noted scleral icterus and hepatomegaly.
- Baseline labs (at presentation): ALT 193 U/L (normal <55), AST 123 U/L (normal <37), alkaline phosphatase 238 U/L (normal <130), total bilirubin 5.5 mg/dL (normal <1.2), LDH 570 U/L (normal 130–250).
- Imaging (baseline): CT abdomen showed pancreatic head mass with invasion of the superior mesenteric vein, biliary obstruction requiring metal common bile duct stent, aortocaval adenopathy, and multiple bilobar liver metastases with portal vein bland thrombus and intrahepatic biliary dilatation.

## Diagnosis and pathology
- Tissue: diagnostic core biopsy from liver metastasis.
- Histology: poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (PDNEC) with geographic necrosis, frequent mitoses; large nests/fields of small tumor cells.
- Immunohistochemistry: pan-cytokeratin positive, CK7 positive, CK20 negative; chromogranin and synaptophysin positive confirming neuroendocrine differentiation; Ki-67 ~90% (high proliferative index); p53 aberrant loss of expression; Rb loss of expression.
- Final clinicopathologic diagnosis: high-grade PDNEC (WHO criteria: mitotic count >20/2 mm2 and Ki-67 typically >55%), extensive metastatic disease to liver at presentation.

## Baseline performance status and organ function
- At presentation: ill-appearing with hepatic dysfunction per labs above; required inpatient evaluation and biliary stenting.
- Systemic performance status during olaparib maintenance: reported excellent quality of life while on PARP inhibitor therapy; chemotherapy discontinued because of cumulative toxicities (fatigue, neuropathy).

## Initial systemic therapy and response
- First-line therapy: cisplatin + etoposide (6 cycles). Atezolizumab was added for the latter three of six cycles (extrapolated from SCLC regimens).
- Response to platinum chemotherapy ± atezolizumab: rapid and marked radiologic tumor regression in both pancreatic primary and liver metastases after 2 months.
- Cumulative toxicity led to discontinuation of platinum-based therapy; olaparib started as maintenance therapy due to BRCA2 germline pathogenic variant.
- Imaging on olaparib: continued radiologic regression; deep and durable disease control extracranially documented on serial CTs (responses noted at 6 months of olaparib and ongoing up to ~26 months from diagnosis for extracranial disease).

## Genomic and molecular findings
- Platform: targeted tumor/germline sequencing performed with the MSK-IMPACT panel; copy-number and LOH by FACETS; CCF by ABSOLUTE.
- Germline finding: pathogenic BRCA2 germline variant (documented in manuscript). Tumor showed somatic loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) of the BRCA2 wild-type allele consistent with biallelic BRCA2 inactivation and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD).
- Key somatic alterations (pre-treatment tumor):
  - KRAS p.G12R hotspot mutation (oncogenic).
  - TP53 frameshift/truncating alteration with associated aberrant p53 IHC (biallelic loss-of-function).
  - RB1 frameshift/truncating alteration with loss of Rb protein expression (biallelic loss-of-function).
  - CDKN1B homozygous deletion (truncal event; persistent across samples).
  - Additional somatic events listed in the manuscript: AMER1, STK11, ZFHX3, ROS1 in-frame deletion, MAP3K1, INSR alterations.
- Tumor mutational burden (TMB): 6.2 mutations/Mb (reported in manuscript).
- Clonality: BRCA2 LOH and other canonical driver alterations were clonal/truncal by CCF analyses.
- VAF / read depth: specific VAFs/read depths for the principal pre-treatment somatic variants are not explicitly reported; cfDNA ATM p.L695Wfs*5 detected at 0.28% VAF at intracranial recurrence and interpreted as likely clonal hematopoiesis.

## Evolution under therapy and resistance
- Maintenance olaparib produced further tumor regression and prolonged extracranial disease control for 17 months after initiation.
- New neurologic symptoms at 17 months led to MRI showing an isolated right parietal enhancing lesion with vasogenic edema; resected and confirmed as PDNEC metastasis.
- Sequencing of two resected CNS metastases revealed BRCA2 structural rearrangements spanning the germline pathogenic locus, absent in the pre-treatment liver biopsy, predicted to restore BRCA2 reading frame/function (reversion) and confer PARPi resistance.
- CNS lesions displayed convergent evolution and divergent subclonal patterns; extracranial disease remained controlled.
- Local CNS therapies (resection + stereotactic radiotherapy; subsequent craniotomy/radiotherapy for dural lesions) failed to control intracranial disease; patient died 26 months after diagnosis.

## Biomarker/ancillary data
- IHC: Ki-67 ~90%; chromogranin and synaptophysin positive; p53 and Rb loss concordant with sequencing.
- MSI: not reported; TMB = 6.2 muts/Mb.
- cfDNA at intracranial progression: ATM p.L695Wfs*5 at 0.28% VAF, interpreted as likely clonal hematopoiesis.

## Key clinical takeaways
- This case shows deep platinum sensitivity and prolonged PARPi response in a PDNEC with biallelic BRCA2 loss.
- Isolated CNS progression caused by BRCA2 reversion demonstrates restoration of HR as an acquired resistance mechanism to PARPi and highlights CNS sanctuary issues.
- Sequential genomic profiling at progression clarified mechanism and guided consideration of alternative/differential strategies (DDR combinations, clinical trials).

## Q1 (031_1)

Given this patient’s diagnostic features (high‑grade PDNEC with Ki‑67 ~90%, liver‑dominant metastatic disease, and biallelic BRCA2 loss), was first‑line treatment with platinum‑based chemotherapy (cisplatin + etoposide) ± atezolizumab an appropriate standard‑of‑care choice, and why?

### Answer 1

Yes. Platinum doublet chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin with etoposide or irinotecan) is the standard initial systemic therapy for poorly differentiated high‑grade neuroendocrine carcinomas because of their rapid proliferation and sensitivity to DNA‑damaging agents. The addition of PD‑L1 blockade (atezolizumab) was an extrapolation from extensive‑stage small‑cell lung cancer and is reasonable in select situations or trials but is not definitively established for extrapulmonary PDNEC. The presence of germline BRCA2 predicts platinum sensitivity and is not a contraindication.

---

## Q2 (031_2)

For maintenance therapy after a response to platinum chemotherapy in a patient with germline BRCA2 and confirmed tumor LOH, was initiating olaparib monotherapy an evidence‑based decision, and what is the level of evidence supporting this practice in pancreatic malignancies?

### Answer 2

Yes as an evidence‑based extrapolation. The randomized phase III POLO trial showed maintenance olaparib improved progression‑free survival in metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients with germline BRCA who did not progress on platinum chemotherapy (NEJM, Golan et al. 2019). While POLO enrolled pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (not PDNEC), biallelic BRCA2 inactivation and platinum sensitivity provide a biologic rationale to extrapolate PARP maintenance to this patient. Level of evidence: high for BRCA‑mutant pancreatic adenocarcinoma (POLO RCT); lower (extrapolated) for PDNEC.

---

## Q3 (031_3)

Mechanistically, how did the BRCA2 structural rearrangement (spanning the germline pathogenic locus in the CNS metastases) confer clinical resistance to olaparib in this patient?

### Answer 3

The structural rearrangement restored BRCA2 coding continuity across the germline pathogenic deletion site, reconstituting BRCA2 open reading frame and homologous recombination proficiency. Restoration of HR repair abrogates the synthetic‑lethal vulnerability exploited by PARP inhibitors, leading to clinical resistance. Such reversion mutations/structural events are well documented mechanisms of PARPi resistance.

## Q4 (031_4)

Could switching to an alternative PARP inhibitor with purportedly greater CNS penetration (e.g., niraparib or talazoparib) at the time of isolated brain relapse have been expected to prevent or control the CNS progression in this patient, given the molecular findings?

### Answer 4

Unlikely. Although some PARP inhibitors (e.g., niraparib) may achieve higher CNS exposure in preclinical models, clinically relevant efflux by P‑glycoprotein/BCRP limits CNS penetration for many PARPi, and importantly, the CNS lesions harbored BRCA2 reversion events restoring HR. Restoration of HR confers resistance regardless of drug CNS penetration, so switching PARPi alone would not be expected to overcome the genomic resistance mechanism.

---

## Q5 (031_5)

After identification of BRCA2 reversion in CNS tissue and continued extracranial control, which systemic therapeutic strategies would be rational to consider and which would likely be futile, given the genomic data?

### Answer 5

Likely futile: continued single‑agent PARP inhibitor therapy and platinum rechallenge are unlikely to be effective if BRCA2 reversion restores HR. Rational approaches (ideally within clinical trials) include DDR combination strategies (e.g., ATR inhibitors ± PARP inhibitors), POLQ (Polθ) inhibitors in combination with PARPi, and other investigational agents that may overcome restored HR. Enrollment onto trials testing such combinations or novel DDR agents is the preferred strategy; local CNS therapy remains essential for intracranial control.

---

## Q6 (031_6)

Should baseline brain imaging (MRI) and consideration of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) be standard for patients with extrapulmonary PDNEC who have BRCA‑associated HRD and achieve systemic control?

### Answer 6

No. Routine baseline brain MRI and PCI are not standard for extrapulmonary PDNEC. Unlike extensive‑stage small‑cell lung cancer, there is insufficient evidence to support PCI in extrapulmonary NECs. Baseline brain MRI may be reasonable in selected high‑risk cases, but PCI is not guideline‑recommended.

---

## Q7 (031_7)

How should the cfDNA finding of ATM p.L695Wfs*5 at 0.28% VAF be interpreted in this clinical context, and what implications does it have for management?

### Answer 7

Interpreted most consistently as clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) given the very low VAF (0.28%) and absence in tissue. Management implication: do not change tumor‑directed therapy on this basis alone; annotate as likely CHIP and consider hematology follow‑up only if clinical or laboratory findings suggest a hematologic process.

---

## Q8 (031_8)

What is the prognostic and therapeutic significance of co‑occurring truncal KRAS p.G12R, TP53 loss, RB1 loss, and CDKN1B homozygous deletion in this PDNEC patient?

### Answer 8

This co‑alteration pattern indicates aggressive biology and lineage fidelity to high‑grade NEC: TP53 and RB1 biallelic loss are characteristic of poorly differentiated NECs and predict poor prognosis; KRAS G12R reflects pancreatic lineage and drives oncogenic signaling but has no approved targeted therapy in this context; CDKN1B loss contributes to cell‑cycle dysregulation. These findings support upfront cytotoxic therapy and limit currently approved targeted options, favoring clinical‑trial enrollment for targeted strategies.

---

## Q9 (031_9)

Regarding trial eligibility and sequencing: would the presence of a documented BRCA2 reversion in CNS lesions typically permit enrollment onto PARP‑based clinical trials or PARPi rechallenge studies, and what trial designs or inclusion criteria should be sought instead?

### Answer 9

Documented BRCA2 reversion that restores HR commonly excludes patients from PARPi‑sensitivity–based trials and PARPi rechallenge studies. Instead, seek trials designed for PARPi‑resistant disease or that test DDR combination strategies (e.g., ATR inhibitors ± PARP inhibitors), POLQ inhibitors ± PARPi, or other novel agents addressing resistance mechanisms. Protocol‑specific eligibility and central genomic review are often required.

---

## Q10 (031_10)

For optimal multidisciplinary management of the isolated, symptomatic right parietal metastasis in this patient (given extracranial control on olaparib), what sequence and combination of local and systemic therapies is recommended to maximize intracranial control and preserve neurologic function?

### Answer 10

For a single symptomatic resectable brain metastasis, neurosurgical resection followed by postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy to the resection cavity is standard to relieve mass effect and achieve local control. Whole‑brain radiotherapy is reserved for diffuse disease. Given BRCA2 reversion, systemic single‑agent PARPi is unlikely to control the lesion; systemic therapy decisions should favor trials for PARPi‑resistant disease if available. Care should be multidisciplinary (neurosurgery, radiation oncology, neuro‑oncology, medical oncology).
